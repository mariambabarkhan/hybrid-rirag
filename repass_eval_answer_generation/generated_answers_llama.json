        "Answer": "Exceptions or modifications to the real-time reporting requirements for Virtual Asset transactions may be applicable under specific circumstances. In accordance with the provided context, these exceptions or modifications may be granted as part of the FSRA's regulatory framework for Virtual Assets.\n\nFirstly, the FSRA acknowledges that certain obligations may not apply to all Authorised Persons, particularly those that are 'dealing' in Accepted Virtual Assets (Application of particular Rules in COBS). This implies that exemptions or modifications to reporting requirements might be granted, depending on the specific nature of the Authorised Person's activities.\n\nSecondly, under the RegLab, the FSRA may waive or modify specific rules, including reporting requirements, for FinTech Participants (Blank-Sheet Approach). This typically involves setting client and exposure limits, imposing boundaries/geographical restrictions, and controlling the scope and scale of the FinTech Participant's test activities to minimize client impact and protect their interests.\n\nThe application of these exceptions or modifications can be found in section 5.2 of the regulatory framework, which outlines the Authorisation Requirements (Refer to section 5.2 below titled Authorisation Requirements for further details). However, any market operator, custodian, or intermediary dealing in Virtual Assets must be approved by the FSRA as an FSP holder in relation to the applicable Regulated Activity.\n\nAdditionally, an Applicant seeking to be permitted to conduct activities in relation to Specified Investments / Financial Instruments, in addition to Virtual Assets, will need to apply to the FSRA and comply with relevant requirements, including those related to fees (Features of the Virtual Asset Framework).\n\nIn summary, exceptions or modifications to the real-time reporting requirements for Virtual Asset transactions might be applicable in the following circumstances:\n1. When the obligations do not apply to all Authorised Persons, particularly those 'dealing' in Accepted Virtual Assets.\n2. For FinTech Participants under the RegLab, where specific rules may be waived or modified.\n3.

It also emphasizes the importance of periodic stress tests on exposures against the realizable value of any collateral considered under the FCSA or FCCA.\n\nThe remainder of the context covers various topics unrelated to Rule 4.15.12, such as Simplified CDD, Tax Reporting Regulations, NFTF business, and Accepted Virtual Assets. These topics do not provide additional information on exceptions or specific circumstances under Rule 4.15.12.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of exceptions or specific circumstances under Rule 4.15.12 where the ADGM would allow the use of the original collateral value instead of the stressed value. The rule clearly states that the lower value between the collateral value under the stress scenario and the original value should be used when determining the exposure value.\n\nIt is essential to note that this response is based on the provided context, which might not be comprehensive or up-to-date. For a definitive answer, it is recommended to consult the relevant regulatory documents or contact the ADGM directly."

According to FEES Rule 3.15.1, the MTF must pay the FSRA a trading levy on a sliding scale basis, payable monthly in USD. \n\nTo accurately calculate the trading levy, the MTF should determine the average daily value at 12am Abu Dhabi time (+4hr GMT) unless otherwise determined and agreed upon with the FSRA. \n\nThe average daily value should be categorised according to the specified ranges, and the corresponding trading levy percentage applied: \n- ADV \u2264 10m: 0.0015% \n- 10m < ADV \u2264 50m: 0.0012%\n- 50m < ADV \u2264 250m: 0.0009%\n- ADV > 250m: 0.0006%\n\nIn case of significant fluctuations in average daily value within a single month, the MTF should ensure that the calculation of the average daily value is representative of the entire month. \n\nAdditionally, if the MTF intends to extend its operations to include Digital Securities, it must demonstrate its ability to comply with the requirements applicable to operating an MTF in the context of undertaking new Digital Securities-related financial services.\n\nIn terms of fees for upgrading to a Digital Securities RIE, the MTF can expect to pay a fee in the region of US$40,000, rather than the full RIE Recognition Order fee of US$125,000, provided there is significant overlap in the systems, controls, and technology used by the entity across both activities.\n\nIt's essential for the MTF to note that the FSRA may impose a full RIE Recognition Order fee if the MTF fails to demonstrate sufficient overlap in systems, controls, and technology.\n\nThere are no explicit requirements or procedures outlined in the regulatory documents for handling significant fluctuations in average daily value within a single month, but it's crucial for the MTF to accurately calculate the average daily value to ensure compliance with the applicable trading levy."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, here's a detailed and structured answer to the question.\n\n**How does the ADGM define and assess the independence of the valuer appointed under section 40, and what criteria must this valuer meet?**\n\nAlthough the context does not explicitly define the process for assessing the independence of the valuer appointed under section 40, some inferences can be made from the overall regulatory framework. Specifically, Principle 4 - Risk-Sensitive Supervision and Rule 9.2.7 can provide some insights. \n\n* **Independence Assessment:** The ADGM will likely consider the general principles of independence when assessing the appointed valuer. In the context of audit committees (not explicitly mentioned for the appointed valuer), it is stated that if an auditor provides non-audit services, the auditor's objectivity and independence should be safeguarded (Annual Report section). The regulator might apply similar criteria to ensure the valuer's independence.\n  \n* **Criteria for Appointment:** Section 40 requires eligibility criteria for the appointed valuer, but these criteria are not explicitly specified in the context. However, the regulatory framework emphasizes the importance of expertise and independence in various roles. The FSRA's approach to authorisation and supervision, as stated in Principle 4 - Risk-Sensitive Supervision, underscores the importance of risk management and sound controls. The appointed valuer likely needs to demonstrate expertise and independence in carrying out the valuation.\n\nAdditional regulatory requirements for the appointed valuer under section 40, such as experience or qualifications, are not mentioned in the context. However, in the context of Digital Securities, all entities are required to consider and comply with International Tax Reporting Obligations, including FATCA and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017. The appointed valuer under section 40 may need to adhere to similar obligations if applicable.\n\nUltimately, more specific information about the eligibility criteria and independence assessment for the valuer under section 40 is needed to provide a definitive answer."

        "Answer": "Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly address the frequency of FSRA reviews or audits of Authorised Persons to ensure adherence to the Spot Commodities Framework. However, based on the information available in the context, it is possible to outline the expectations and procedures that FSRA follows to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements of the Spot Commodities Framework.\n\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Accepted Spot Commodities to commit resources of a nature allowing them to be operating in substance within ADGM. The FSRA's regulatory approach under the Spot Commodities Framework is to set out clear regulatory obligations for those Persons undertaking Spot Commodity activities within or from ADGM, with the intention of strengthening transparency, supporting and fostering market integrity, identifying and combating issues relating to sustainability, and providing a regulatory framework relating to delivery, settlement, and key transactional activities.\n\nThe REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS for SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES section outlines the expectations for Delivery & Storage, which includes adherence to good or sound storage practices as established in COBS Rules 22.4.1 to 22.4.6. Additionally, the FSRA considers a Spot Commodity as a good sold for cash and promptly delivered when the transaction is settled, and not a contract for the sale of a commodity under which delivery is to be made at a future date.\n\nAlthough the context does not provide a direct answer to the question, it can be inferred that the FSRA may conduct reviews or audits of Authorised Persons to ensure adherence to the Spot Commodities Framework, which may include assessing their commitment to operating in substance within ADGM, adherence to good or sound storage practices, and compliance with COBS Rules.\n\nHowever, without explicit information on the frequency of such reviews or audits, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. Nevertheless, a review or audit by the FSRA would likely entail assessing the Authorised Person's compliance with the regulatory requirements of the Spot Commodities Framework, including:\n\n1. Substantive resources committed within ADGM across all lines of the Authorised Person's activities, including commercial, governance, compliance, market surveillance, operations, technical, IT, finance, and HR functions.\n2. Adherence to good or sound storage practices as established in COBS Rules 22.4.1 to 22.4.6.\n3. Compliance with COBS Rules and the definition of a Spot Commodity outlined in the context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the context does not explicitly provide information on the frequency of FSRA reviews or audits of Authorised Persons, it is possible to infer that the FSRA may conduct reviews or audits to ensure adherence to the Spot Commodities Framework, which would entail assessing compliance with the outlined regulatory requirements and procedures."

The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resources and an Exploration Target that may be added to the end of the mine plan depends on the maturity of a Mining Project.  For example, a greater proportion may be justified by a producing mine (or a Mining Production Reporting Entity) with a history of converting Exploration Targets and Mineral Resources into Ore Reserves, than a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity that has Indicated Mineral Resources as the highest confidence Mineral Resource.

While in many circumstances this may be obvious, in others circumstances it may not be as clear.  This potential challenge is inescapable, however, as it is the Reporting Entity, and only the Reporting Entity, that can and must form a view as to whether the information of which it is aware (and the rest of the market is not aware of) is Inside Information, and therefore needs to be Disclosed under Rule 7.2.1.\n"

        "Answer": "A Trust Service Provider is required to inform the Regulator immediately about the termination or imminent termination of a trustee's appointment. This immediate notification is a critical regulatory obligation, and the Trust Service Provider must also provide reasons for the resignation and the measures taken to ensure a new trustee has been appointed. There is no specified time period other than 'immediately', which indicates a rapid response is necessary for the Trust Service Provider to meet this regulatory requirement.\n\nThe requirement for 'immediate' notification does not provide a specific timeframe such as hours, days, or weeks, instead emphasizing the urgency and promptness with which the Trust Service Provider must inform the Regulator. As stated, the Trust Service Provider must provide the reasons for the resignation and measures taken to appoint a new trustee, which suggests a comprehensive and thorough notification process.\n\nThis regulatory obligation aligns with the broader requirements for a Trust Service Provider to ensure adequate procedures, maintain sound business principles, and comply with relevant legislation. The immediate notification of a trustee's termination or imminent termination contributes to these objectives by ensuring that the Regulator is promptly informed of significant changes that may impact the Trust Service Provider's operations or clients.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the required timeframe for a Trust Service Provider to inform the Regulator about the termination or imminent termination of a trustee's appointment is 'immediately', with no specific quantitative timeframe given, and must include reasons for the resignation and measures taken to appoint a new trustee."

            "DISCLOSURES TO BE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MINING REPORTING STANDARDS . The FSRA considers that Rules 11.2.1 and 11.2.2 are the most important Rules in relation to the requirement for Minerals activity disclosures within ADGM.  Rule 11.2.1 requires that any disclosure by a Mining Reporting Entity that includes a statement about Exploration Targets, Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves or Production Targets, must be prepared in accordance with a Mining Reporting Standard and in accordance with the requirements of MKT Chapter 11.\n",
            "INTRODUCTION. The disclosure framework for Mining Reporting Entities in Chapter 11 of MKT is substantially driven by three Mining Reporting Standards; the JORC Code, the SAMREC Code and NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards.  These Mining Reporting Standards set guidelines that provide for standardised definitions and a comprehensive classification system for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.  The FSRA intends for Chapter 11 of MKT to work closely, and be consistent, with the Mining Reporting Standards.  If there are any inconsistencies, however, between FSMR or MKT and the Mining Reporting Standards, FSMR or MKT will prevail.  However, this does not mean that where a Mining Reporting Standards requirement is not required under FSMR or MKT that it is acceptable for the Mining Reporting Standard requirement to be ignored.\n",
            "EXPLORATION TARGETS . The FSRA considers that it is implicit within the Mining Reporting Standards, and the treatment of Exploration Targets under the Mining Reporting Standards, that subsequent Exploration of an Exploration Target is to be directed towards the estimation of a Mineral Resource.  As the Mining Reporting Standards do not allow a Mining Reporting Entity to disclose a Mineral Resource that has no prospects of eventual economic Extraction, the FSRA also expects that a Mining Reporting Entity cannot disclose an Exploration Target where it is apparent that the tonnage and/or grade is so low (or so deep) or otherwise not extractable, that the Mineralisation has no prospects of being economically mined within a reasonable timeframe.  To do so would be misleading, and in breach of MKT and FSMR (for further information on misleading statements, refer to paragraph 67).\n",
            "PRODUCTION TARGETS .\nRule 11.8 sets out the requirements for disclosing certain types of Production Targets.  The FSRA emphasises that Production Targets are forward looking statements. A Production Target must, therefore, be based on reasonable grounds or it will otherwise be deemed misleading.  An appropriate level of due diligence must, as a result, be applied to the preparation of a Production Target.  The assumptions and underlying figures used in preparing a Production Target need to be carefully vetted and signed off at a suitably senior level within the Mining Reporting Entity before it is disclosed.\n",
            "Production Targets \u2013 what can they be disclosed in relation to?  Rule 11.8.3(4) provides that, among other things, the Inferred Mineral Resources and Exploration Target (as applicable) do not feature as a significant proportion in the early mine plan.  The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resources and an Exploration Target that may be added to the end of the mine plan depends on the maturity of a Mining Project.  For example, a greater proportion may be justified by a producing mine (or a Mining Production Reporting Entity) with a history of converting Exploration Targets and Mineral Resources into Ore Reserves, than a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity that has Indicated Mineral Resources as the highest confidence Mineral Resource.  For the purpose of this Rule, therefore, the FSRA interprets the phrase \u2018significant proportion\u2019 to mean 25% or less of the Mineralisation used to determine the Production Target is attributed to Inferred Mineral Resources and/or an Exploration Target.\n\n",
            "DISCLOSURES TO BE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRMS . The FSRA considers that Rules 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 are the most important Rules in relation to the requirement for Petroleum activity disclosures within ADGM.  Rule 12.2.1 requires that any disclosure by a Petroleum Reporting Entity that includes a statement about Petroleum Resources, including estimates of Prospective Resources, Contingent Resources or Petroleum Reserves, must be prepared in accordance with both the PRMS and Chapter 12 of MKT.\n",
            "PRODUCTION TARGETS\nWhat constitutes reasonable grounds?\nAs set out above, it is the responsibility of a Mining Reporting Entity disclosing a Production Target to ensure that it has reasonable grounds to do so.  \u2018Reasonable grounds\u2019 extend not only to the Mineralisation underpinning a Production Target, but also to any assumptions regarding modifying factors (including, for example, the \u2018modifying factors; set out within Table 1 of the SAMREC Code or JORC Code).\n",

Any disclosure by a Mining Reporting Entity regarding Exploration Targets must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Mining Reporting Standards (JORC Code, SAMREC Code, and NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards), as outlined in Rule 11.2.1 and the disclosure framework in Chapter 11 of MKT.\n\n2. The Mining Reporting Entity must ensure that the subsequent Exploration of an Exploration Target is directed towards the estimation of a Mineral Resource, as implicitly required by the Mining Reporting Standards, to avoid disclosing Exploration Targets with no prospects of eventual economic Extraction.\n\n3. The Mining Reporting Entity must also ensure that the disclosed Exploration Target has reasonable prospects of being economically mined within a reasonable timeframe, considering factors such as tonnage, grade, and extractability.\n\n4. When disclosing Production Targets, the Mining Reporting Entity must base them on reasonable grounds, requiring an appropriate level of due diligence in the preparation of the Production Target.\n\n5. The Mining Reporting Entity must carefully vet and sign off on the assumptions and underlying figures used in preparing the Production Target at a suitably senior level before disclosure.\n\n6. The disclosed Production Target must not feature Inferred Mineral Resources and Exploration Targets as a significant proportion (more than 25%) in the early mine plan, as per Rule 11.8.3(4), unless the Mining Project's maturity justifies a greater proportion.\n\n7. The Mining Reporting Entity must consider 'reasonable grounds' to include not only the Mineralisation underpinning the Production Target but also assumptions regarding modifying factors, such as those set out in Table 1 of the SAMREC Code or JORC Code.\n\n8. The Mining Reporting Entity must have suitable compliance systems and controls in place to ensure continuous disclosure obligations are met and can respond to continuous disclosure events in a timely manner, as per the general compliance requirements.\n\nBy following these procedures and requirements, a Mining Reporting Entity can ensure compliance with the Mining Reporting Standards and the FSRA's regulatory framework when disclosing Exploration Targets and Production Targets."

This includes the ability to reconstruct any transaction processed by or through the Relevant Person on behalf of a customer or other third party.\n\nTo satisfy this requirement, the Relevant Person must maintain records of all transactions, including details of the customer or third party involved, in a way that enables them to be identified. This implies that the Relevant Person should have a system in place to store and retrieve transaction data, including information about the parties involved, the transaction amount, date, and time.\n\nThe Regulator's expectation is that the Relevant Person will be able to reconstruct transactions to the level of detail required to assess compliance with applicable legislation. This may involve having access to information about the transaction, including but not limited to, the parties involved, the transaction amount, date, and time, as well as any other relevant details.\n\nIn the event of a regulatory enquiry or court order to disclose information, the Relevant Person must be able to satisfy the request within an appropriate time frame. This suggests that the Relevant Person's record-keeping system should be designed to facilitate prompt retrieval of information, to enable them to respond to regulatory enquiries or court orders in a timely manner.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Regulator's requirements for reconstructing transactions are part of a broader set of regulatory obligations, including the need to identify and report suspicious transactions, and to maintain records of customer and transaction information. Relevant Persons should ensure that their systems and procedures are designed to meet all of these regulatory requirements.\n\nThe requirements for reconstructing transactions also relate to other sections of the Rules, including the need for Authorised Persons to maintain records of customer and transaction information, and to have systems and procedures in place to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing."

Rule 6.9.10 is part of a broader regulatory framework that emphasizes a risk-based approach (RBA) to ensure that Authorised Persons can manage their risks and maintain robust technology governance and controls.\n\nTo establish the value of technical provisions, a Captive Insurer must normally correspond to the current amount the Captive Insurer would have to pay if it were to transfer its insurance and reinsurance obligations immediately to another entity (paragraph 1, context). The value must also be equal to the sum of a best estimate and a risk margin, unless the alternative approach is permitted in accordance with Rule 6.9.10.\n\nWhile the context does not explicitly outline the alternative approach or approval process, it can be inferred that any alternative approach should be consistent with the principles of sound risk management and governance, as emphasized throughout the regulatory documents.\n\nTo develop an alternative approach, a Captive Insurer should likely demonstrate that it has a robust risk management framework in place, which includes:\n\n1. A thorough assessment of the risks associated with its insurance and reinsurance obligations;\n2. A clear understanding of the current amount that would have to be paid if these obligations were transferred immediately to another entity; and\n3.

Two examples of this would be where:\n\na)\ta Reporting Entity has selectively picked its Disclosures, Disclosing \u2018positive\u2019 information of a particular type that is likely to have a positive effect on the market price of a Listed Entity\u2019s Securities, but then declining to Disclose \u2018negative\u2019 information of the same type that would be likely to have a negative effect on the market price of the Listed Entity\u2019s Securities, on the incorrect basis or assumption that it is not Inside Information or it is protected from Disclosure by Rule 7.2.2; or\n\nb)\twhere the Inside Information needs to be Disclosed in order to prevent the Disclosure of other Inside Information under Rule 7.2.1 from being misleading or deceptive.\n",

        "Answer": "If a Reporting Entity is found to have delayed the disclosure of Inside Information without valid exemption, the possible consequences or penalties may include:\n\n1. The Listing Authority may issue an 'aware letter' to the Reporting Entity (see paragraphs 187 to 189 above), indicating that it has breached Rule 7.2.1 by failing to disclose Inside Information promptly.\n\n2. The Listing Authority may take 'other relevant action' (as stated in the regulatory documents), which may include imposing fines, penalties, or other disciplinary measures on the Reporting Entity for non-compliance with continuous disclosure obligations.\n\n3. In circumstances where the delayed disclosure has resulted in a false market, the Listing Authority may require the Reporting Entity to disclose the Inside Information immediately, even if the Reporting Entity considers that the Inside Information falls within the exceptions of Rule 7.2.2.\n\n4. The Listing Authority may also consider whether a reasonable person would expect the information to be disclosed, and if so, direct the Reporting Entity to disclose the Inside Information promptly, overruling any exemption claimed under Rule 7.2.2.\n\n5. Additionally, the Listing Authority may investigate the Reporting Entity's internal systems, processes, and controls to determine whether they are adequate to ensure that Inside Information is promptly brought to the attention of its Officers. If these systems and processes are found to be inadequate, the Reporting Entity may be required to implement corrective measures.\n\n6. If the Listing Authority determines that the delayed disclosure was due to the Reporting Entity selectively picking its disclosures, or failing to disclose information that is necessary to prevent other disclosed information from being misleading or deceptive, the Listing Authority may take additional action to enforce compliance with Rule 7.2.1.\n\n7. The Reporting Entity may also face disciplinary action, including fines or other penalties, for failing to establish effective arrangements to deny access to Inside Information to persons other than those who require it for the exercise of their functions within the Reporting Entity.\n\nOverall, the consequences of delaying the disclosure of Inside Information without valid exemption can be severe and may result in various regulatory actions, fines, and penalties, as well as reputational damage to the Reporting Entity."

The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resources and an Exploration Target that may be added to the end of the mine plan depends on the maturity of a Mining Project.  For example, a greater proportion may be justified by a producing mine (or a Mining Production Reporting Entity) with a history of converting Exploration Targets and Mineral Resources into Ore Reserves, than a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity that has Indicated Mineral Resources as the highest confidence Mineral Resource.

        "Answer": "To evaluate the robustness and responsiveness of an Authorised Person's risk model in relation to changes in market conditions or risk profile, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulator would typically consider the following critical aspects:\n\n1. **Governance and control framework**: The Authorised Person must have an integrated governance and control framework that enables its Governing Body and senior management to receive and review regular reports concerning the entity, ensuring they are informed about changes to market conditions or the risk profile.\n\n2. **Conceptual soundness and integrity**: The regulator must be satisfied that the Authorised Person's risk management system is conceptually sound and implemented with integrity, including its models and methodology for calculating the Market Risk Capital Requirement.\n\n3. **Expertise and skilled staff**: The Authorised Person must have sufficient numbers of staff skilled in the use of sophisticated models, not only in the trading area but also in the risk control, audit, and back-office areas, to ensure that the models are effectively implemented and monitored.\n\n4. **Proven track record**: The Authorised Person's models must have a proven track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risk, including under stress testing conditions, to ensure that they can accurately capture changes in market conditions or risk profile.\n\n5. **Stress testing and review process**: The Authorised Person must regularly conduct stress tests, and it should have policies and procedures in place to address new products, activities, processes, and systems, including reviewing and approving them, considering inherent risks, and assessing residual risks, impact on Operational Risk profile, appetite, and tolerance.\n\n6. **Risk management framework**: The Authorised Person must have a well-defined risk management framework that includes a documented policy that addresses its risk appetite, and procedures for identifying, assessing, mitigating, controlling, and monitoring risk.\n\n7. **Threshold Conditions**: To maintain a Financial Services Permission, the Authorised Person must comply with Threshold Conditions, which may include requirements for capital adequacy and distributions across the Financial Group.\n\n8. **Regulatory review and feedback**: The ADGM regulator will only approve the use of an internal risk model if it is satisfied that the requirements outlined above have been met. The regulator may seek independent expert opinions and may conduct its own review or request the Authorised Person to conduct an internal review to ensure compliance with these obligations.\n\n9. **Regular review and testing**: The Authorised Person must regularly review and test its risk models and procedures, including liquidity risk testing and analysis of Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports to ensure they remain effective in managing the current and future risk profile.\n\n10. **FinTech Proposal evaluation**: For Authorised Persons participating in the RegLab framework, the evaluation criteria for the FinTech Proposal will also consider how it promotes significant growth, efficiency, or competition in the financial sector, improves risk management solutions, and enhances client welfare, and whether it can be deployed in the ADGM and UAE on a broader scale.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADGM regulator assesses the robustness and responsiveness of an Authorised Person's risk model by requiring a comprehensive, well-defined risk management framework, with regular testing and review processes, a strong governance and control framework, adequate expertise and skilled staff, and evidence of stress testing to assess the model's ability to capture changes in market conditions or risk profile.\n\nBy aligning its requirements with these detailed and structured obligations and avoiding any contradictions, the ADGM regulator can ensure that Authorised Persons have robust and effective risk models that accurately capture their current and future risk profile, aligning with regulatory objectives and expectations."

        "Answer": "In the context of the MENA region, Peer-to-Peer Financing Platforms (PFPs) can leverage data and technology to benefit small businesses seeking funding in several ways, while adhering to various regulatory obligations.\n\nFirstly, PFPs may include equity funding, private placement, and invoice financing platforms that utilize data and technology to unlock new ways of raising money for small businesses from professional investors (such as high net worth individuals, private equity, venture capital, family offices, accelerators/incubators, and angel investors). This is in line with the regulatory framework that aims to improve access to alternative financing for start-ups and SMEs, which are key engines of economic growth and diversification in the MENA region.\n\nTo operate effectively, PFPs must comply with data protection obligations for Authorised Persons, as outlined in the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2015. Specifically, as data controllers, PFPs must protect personal data in compliance with these regulations and determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, personal data is processed. Failure to do so may result in enforcement action and compensation claims from individuals.\n\nFurthermore, PFPs must adhere to the requirements outlined in the General Rulebook (GEN) and the Principles for Authorised Persons, particularly with regards to the experience and qualifications of key personnel. For instance, Senior Executive Officers must have at least ten years of experience in dealing with Retail Clients in an equivalently regulated environment and hold a directly relevant qualification and membership of an appropriate professional body.\n\nIn addition, PFPs must comply with the FinTech regulatory framework, which aims to facilitate the development, testing, and adoption of promising FinTech innovations. This framework encourages innovation, is tailored and proportionate to the materiality of the risks posed, and supports the time-to-market of new FinTech solutions in a cost-efficient environment.\n\nPFPs must also adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Terrorist Financing (TFS) regulations, specifically the Risk-Based Approach (RBA). This requires Relevant Persons to assess relevant money laundering risks and adopt a proportionate response to such risks. Even for low-risk customers, a minimum of simplified Customer Due Diligence (CDD) must be undertaken.\n\nIn terms of reporting obligations, PFPs conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets must consider obligations in relation to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standards (CRS), as set out in the relevant regulations and guidance.\n\nLastly, PFPs operating in the digital securities and trading venues space must comply with the Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) requirements. This includes the requirement for issuers to have Securities admitted to the Official List and to offer such Securities by way of an Approved Prospectus.\n\nIn summary, PFPs in the MENA region can leverage data and technology to benefit small businesses seeking funding, while adhering to various regulatory obligations, including data protection, GEN and Principles for Authorised Persons, FinTech regulatory framework, AML/TFS regulations, and RIE requirements."

The exception to this is when a Mining Reporting Entity discloses its Summary of Reserves and Resources.  The emphasis, therefore, is on the \u2018materiality\u2019 to a Mining Reporting Entity, rather than whether a Mining Project is significant or not.\n",

Such reasoning should generally follow the considerations outlined in paragraph 24 above.\n",

        ],
        "Answer": "According to the regulatory documents provided, there are exceptions and specific circumstances under which a Mining Reporting Entity might be exempt from disclosing a material change in its estimates. \n\nFirstly, the FSRA does not expect to see a Mining Reporting Entity disclose a change in estimates that are not material. However, if a Mining Reporting Entity discloses estimates/results that it viewed as material at the time of disclosure, but subsequently forms a view that they are no longer material, it must make a further disclosure providing the clear rationale for the change view on materiality.\n\nAdditionally, Rule 11.7.1 prohibits a Mining Reporting Entity from including any Non-Equivalent Estimates of mineralisation in any Technical Study of a Mining Reporting Entity's Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves. This implies that a Mining Reporting Entity may not be required to disclose material changes if the estimates in question are non-equivalent.\n\nMoreover, when disclosing estimates of Probable Ore Reserves or Proved Ore Reserves, a Mining Reporting Entity is required to provide a fair and balanced representation of the information contained in the report prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements. If the economic assumptions are commercially sensitive, the Mining Reporting Entity may report an explanation of the methodology used to determine the assumptions rather than the actual figure, thus implying some flexibility in terms of exemptions from full disclosure.\n\nIt is also important to note that the FSRA may exercise its power to advise a Reporting Entity that it is a Mining Exploration Reporting Entity or a Mining Production Reporting Entity for the purposes of the Rules. However, this does not directly relate to exemptions from disclosing material changes, but rather to the classification of Reporting Entities and their obligations.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 11.3.1(1) requires that a Prospectus that includes a statement about Exploration Targets, Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves, or Production Targets must comply with the relevant requirements, including Chapter 11 of the Rules and a Mining Reporting Standard.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that Inside Information exemptions provided by Rule 7.2.2 may be relevant for Mining Reporting Entities when disclosing material changes. If certain information is considered Inside Information and falls within the exemption, immediate disclosure may not be required.\n\nIn summary, while there are no absolute exemptions from disclosing material changes in estimates, there are specific circumstances and requirements that a Mining Reporting Entity may need to follow, such as providing clear rationales for changes in materiality, excluding non-equivalent estimates, or following commercial sensitivity guidelines for economic assumptions."

Authorised Persons are expected to implement processes and procedures concerning decision making, access to sensitive information, and security systems. A clear audit log of decision making should be kept, and staff with decision-making responsibilities should have adequate expertise, particularly from a technological standpoint.\n\nFrom a technology governance perspective, Authorised Persons should carefully maintain and develop systems and architecture, ensure secure storage and transmission of data, plan for business continuity and client engagement, and have processes and procedures specifying management of personnel and decision-making by qualified staff.\n\nRegarding security measures and procedures, Authorised Persons should have policies and procedures in place to address information security for all personnel, and ensure that personnel are aware of the sensitivity of data and their responsibilities for protecting it. Furthermore, to mitigate \"key person risk,\" Authorised Persons are required to ensure that there is no single individual that holds privileged or sensitive information critical to the operation of the Authorised Person.\n\nFrom a transparency and disclosure standpoint, Authorised Persons are expected to be open with clients regarding decision-making processes and the management of personnel. However, the specific requirements for disclosure in these areas are not directly outlined in the provided regulatory documents. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to infer that Authorised Persons should develop clear policies and procedures for communicating with clients regarding these matters, ensuring that clients are informed and aware of their rights and responsibilities.\n\nIn addition, the ADGM's commitment to sustainability is highlighted in the 2019 Sustainable Finance Agenda, where it outlined its commitment to develop a more sustainable financial system. This includes encouraging sustainable financial products and integrating sustainability considerations into regulations, governance, and risk management.\n\nIn terms of specific disclosure requirements, the regulatory documents primarily focus on the obligations related to fiat token issuers and the spot commodities framework. The requirements for subsequent disclosures of Non-Equivalent Estimates, for instance, are outlined in Rule 11.7.5, which includes a positive confirmation from the Mining Reporting Entity that there is no new material information or data that would impact on the reliability or interpretation of the Non-Equivalent Estimates.\n\nOverall, while the regulatory documents do not provide an exhaustive list of specific requirements for transparency and disclosure to clients regarding decision-making processes and the management of personnel in virtual asset operations, they emphasize the importance of clear policies, procedures, and communication in these areas. Authorised Persons are expected to establish strong compliance cultures, embed regulatory requirements into their operations, and ensure that personnel are aware of their responsibilities for protecting sensitive information."

        "Answer": "To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in the context of virtual asset services, Authorized Persons engaging in regulated activities must implement robust access management procedures and systems to secure APIs. These measures are outlined in the provided regulatory documents.\n\nFirstly, APIs should be secured using strict access management procedures and systems (Regulatory Requirements for Authorized Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets). Access management measures should include the use of access tokens to establish trusted identities and control access to services and resources (API Requirements). Additionally, encryption and signatures should be employed as a standard to protect sensitive data (API Requirements). Secure data transmission through the use of SSL certificates is also recommended (Regulatory Requirements for Authorized Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets).\n\nAPIs should be designed with quotas and throttling in place, which determine how often APIs can be called (API Requirements). This helps in identifying and mitigating potential security threats such as Denial-of-Service attacks. Furthermore, API traffic should be enforced using an API gateway that allows authentication as well as control (API Requirements).\n\nFor API access, activity logging and ongoing security breach scanning are crucial (Regulatory Requirements for Authorized Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets). Moreover, consistent software development methodologies should be adopted to minimize technology-related business failures (API Requirements).\n\nSystems development and implementation should be conducted in a well-defined, documented, and deliberate manner (Regulatory Requirements for Authorized Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets). Regular review and update of the Operational Risk policy are also essential to ensure effective risk management systems (Regulatory Requirements - Authorized Persons Conducting a Regulated Activity in Relation to Virtual Assets \u2013 Extension into Digital Securities Activities).\n\nData protection obligations require data controllers to ensure that personal data is processed fairly, lawfully, and securely; for specific, legitimate purposes; and accurate, up-to-date, and kept for no longer than necessary (Specific FSRA Guidance on the Virtual Asset Framework).\n\nIn summary, Authorized Persons must implement access management procedures that include encryption, identity verification, quotas and throttling, as well as API gateways with authentication controls. Additionally, they should maintain secure data transmission through the use of SSL certificates, adhere to software development methodologies, implement a well-defined approach to system implementation, and maintain accurate and up-to-date data protection practices to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in relation to virtual asset services."

        "Answer": "Based on the context provided, the reporting requirements for an Authorized Person regarding the breakdown of gross income across the eight business lines for operational risk capital assessment are as follows:\n\n1. An Authorized Person using the Standardized Approach must calculate its Operational Risk Capital Requirement (KSA) according to the formula: KSA = {\u03a3 years 1-3 max[\u03a3 (GI1-8 * B1-8), 0]}/3, where GI1-8 represents annual gross income for each of the eight business lines, and B1-8 represents the beta factor for each business line (Rule A7.2.2).\n\n2. The Authorized Person must calculate its Operational Risk Capital Requirement in accordance with Rule A7.2.2, using historical data for a three-year period. If the Authorized Person does not have sufficient data to meet the three-year requirement, it must use forecasted annual gross income projections for the part of the time period where historical data is not available (Rule A7.2.2).\n\n3. In calculating the Operational Risk Capital Requirement, the Authorized Person may aggregate retail and commercial banking using a single beta of 15%. If it is unable to disaggregate gross income in its six other business lines, the Authorized Person can aggregate the total gross income for these six business lines using a beta of 18%, with negative gross income treated as described in the Standardized Approach (Rule A7.3.1).\n\n4. The Authorized Person may offset negative gross income in any business line against positive gross income in other business lines without limit. However, if the aggregate annual gross income across all business lines is negative, the Authorized Person must input a value of zero in the numerator (Rule A7.2.2).\n\n5. For the Alternative Standardized Approach, the Authorized Person must calculate its Operational Risk Capital Requirement for retail banking (KRB) according to the formula: KRB = BRB \u00d7 m \u00d7 LARB, where BRB represents the beta factor for retail banking, LARB represents total outstanding retail loans and advances, and m = 0.035 (Rule A7.3.3).\n\n6. The Authorized Person must calculate its Operational Risk Capital Requirement for commercial banking (KCB) according to the formula: KCB = BCB \u00d7 m \u00d7 LACB, where BCB represents the beta factor for commercial banking, LACB represents total outstanding commercial banking loans and advances, and m = 0.035 (Rule A7.3.3).\n\n7. In addition to these requirements, the Authorized Person must also comply with the risk assessment requirements in Chapter 6 of the PRU, including specific Operational Risk management requirements relating to IT systems, information security, outsourcing, business continuity, and disaster recovery (Chapter 6, PRU).\n\n8. The Authorized Person must also retain records of its calculations and reporting for operational risk capital assessment, as prescribed by the Regulator's Rules.\n\nThese requirements must be adhered to by Authorized Persons when reporting the breakdown of gross income across the eight business lines for operational risk capital assessment."

The SEO must also ensure that the firm has in place adequate systems and controls, including compliance, internal audit, anti-money laundering, risk management, and record-keeping.\n\nFirms must appoint a UAE resident as the Senior Executive Officer, as well as the Compliance Officer and Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO), with the requisite skills and relevant experience in compliance and anti-money laundering duties. These individuals must demonstrate competence to perform the proposed roles and adequate knowledge of the relevant sections of ADGM legislation and, in the case of the MLRO, the wider anti-money laundering legislation.\n\nIn terms of record-keeping, the ADGM regulator may require firms to provide reports from a Skilled Person on specified matters, including the adequacy of systems and controls, such as compliance, internal audit, anti-money laundering, risk management, and record-keeping. The regulator may also request additional supplementary information and documents, including non-financial information such as a firm's internal policies on particular areas of risk and compliance.\n\nFirms must also comply with the ADGM's Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, including full compliance with UAE AML/CFT Federal Laws, the FSRA's AML Rules, and the adoption of international best practices (including FATF Recommendations).\n\nIn conducting a regulatory review, the ADGM regulator may undertake desktop analyses to review a firm's business activities and compliance with ADGM legislation. This may involve analysing information provided by the firm, such as periodic returns, internal management information, ad-hoc questionnaires, published financial information, or specially requested information.\n\nFurthermore, firms must ensure that they have proper systems and controls in place for the transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for auction/trading purposes and custodial purposes. MTF/Virtual Asset Custodian firms must also satisfy the FSRA that they have a proper approval process for and monitoring of the issuers and third-party integrated registries of NFTs.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance, the regulator may take further action, including the imposition of a fee or the exercise of the Write Down or Conversion Power under certain circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the ADGM's expectations for a firm's internal record-keeping practices, particularly concerning compliance and anti-money laundering activities, are:\n\n1. Establish a strong compliance culture and ensure the appointment of competent individuals in compliance and MLRO roles.\n2. Maintain adequate systems and controls, including compliance, internal audit, anti-money laundering, risk management, and record-keeping.\n3. Provide reports from a Skilled Person on specified matters and respond to additional supplementary information and document requests from the regulator.\n4.

This may include conducting additional research on the customer's background, verifying the source of funds, and regularly reviewing the customer's account activity.\n\nAdditional requirements for CDD include:\n\n* **First payment verification**: In certain circumstances, the first payment made by a customer to open an account with a Relevant Person should be carried out through a bank account in the customer's name (Rule 8.4.1).\n* **Information sharing**: Relevant Persons may share CDD information with other Relevant Persons, subject to specific conditions, including customer consent and restrictions on repeated requests (Rules 8.3 and 8.4).\n* **Review and audit**: The Relevant Person's CDD processes should be subject to regular review and audit, either internally or by a competent firm of independent auditors or compliance professionals.\n* **Business continuity planning**: Relevant Persons should have adequate business continuity planning risk management systems in place, including procedures for identifying potential disruptions, managing risk, and maintaining business operations.\n\nIn terms of specific requirements for different types of customers, the regulations do not provide explicit guidance. However, Relevant Persons should be aware of the following general obligations:\n\n* **Financial Counterparties**: Ensure that appropriate procedures and arrangements are in place to measure, monitor, and mitigate operational risk and Counterparty Credit Risk.\n* **Insurance companies**: Have a risk management system in place that includes business continuity planning risk, with policies and procedures for identifying potential disruptions and managing risk.\n\nUltimately, the ADGM expects Relevant Persons to design and implement systems and controls that are reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks associated with their business and customers."

Where a Mining Reporting Entity discloses, for example, a \u2018non-JORC compliant\u2019 estimate of resources or reserves without prior consultation with the FSRA, the FSRA will consider requiring the relevant Mining Reporting Entity to implement a suspension in the trading of its Securities until the Mining Reporting Entity can disclose an appropriate clarification.\n",

Rule 11.5.1(1)(f) requires that a Mining Reporting Entity disclosing estimates of Mineral Resources include, amongst the other information required, a summary of all material information in relation to the mining and metallurgical methods and parameters, and other material modifying factors, considered by the Mining Reporting Entity to date.  In complying with this requirement, the FSRA does not require a Mining Reporting Entity to complete a comprehensive study of all mining and metallurgical methods and parameters.

For example, where a Mining Reporting Entity is required to make a disclosure in relation to mining activities under Rule 7.2.1, the information contained in the disclosure must not only comply with Rule 7.2.1 but also with any applicable Rules within Chapter 11.

        "Answer": "To disclose any material differences between Historical Estimates and estimates prepared under current Mining Reporting Standards, a Mining Reporting Entity must follow specific guidelines to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nFirstly, the FSRA does not allow the inclusion of Historical Estimates in any Technical Study of a Mining Reporting Entity's Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves. Historical Estimates are estimates of Mineralisation prepared prior to the publication of the first editions of the JORC Code, the SAMREC Code, and NI 43-1-1. The FSRA's expectation is that a Mining Reporting Entity wishing to disclose Historical Estimates must first verify them against a Mining Reporting Standard.\n\nIf the Mining Reporting Entity decides to disclose Historical Estimates, they must ensure that the disclosure contains a fair and balanced representation of the information contained in the report prepared in accordance with the Mining Reporting Standards. This report should provide all information that is material to understanding the estimates of Ore Reserves, taking into account the sampling techniques and data, reporting of Exploration results, estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources, estimation and reporting of Ore Reserves, estimation and reporting of diamonds and other gemstones, and material modifying factors.\n\nThe disclosure must also include a summary of all material information in relation to the mining and metallurgical methods and parameters, and other material modifying factors considered in the estimation of the Mineral Resources. The FSRA does not require a comprehensive study of all mining and metallurgical methods and parameters but rather disclosure of the methods and parameters, and material modifying factors considered.\n\nIn cases where certain information is not included because the Mining Reporting Entity considers it not material to understanding the estimates of Ore Reserves, an explanation must be provided as to why the information is not material.\n\nTo disclose any material differences between Historical Estimates and estimates prepared under current Mining Reporting Standards, a Mining Reporting Entity should:\n- Verify the Historical Estimates against a Mining Reporting Standard;\n- Provide a fair and balanced representation of the information contained in the report prepared in accordance with the Mining Reporting Standards;\n- Include a summary of all material information in relation to the mining and metallurgical methods and parameters, and other material modifying factors considered;\n- Explain why certain information is not included if it is considered not material;\n- Comply with the applicable Rules within Chapter 11, as well as with Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 7, and Chapter 10 of the Rules.\n\nBy following these requirements, a Mining Reporting Entity can ensure that the disclosure of any material differences between Historical Estimates and estimates prepared under current Mining Reporting Standards aligns with regulatory obligations and requirements."

Further, it explains that rules provided regarding a run-off plan that ensures an insurer meets its liabilities to policyholders and is also compliant with regulations.\n\nAdditionally, there are directives concerning Recognised Bodies and their Controllers, such as a power to give directions for advancing operational objectives.

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues.

        ],
        "Answer": "There are several anticipated updates and changes to the regulatory framework for Digital Securities intermediaries that stakeholders should prepare for. \n\nFirstly, the existing conventional intermediaries that are licensed by the FSRA are permitted to undertake Regulated Activities within the scope of their existing FSP in relation to Specified Investments, including Digital Securities, but must provide prior notification to their FSRA Supervision Relationship Manager of the proposed changes to their business model (paragraphs 1-3).\n\nRegarding licensed intermediaries that have been authorized to conduct a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, such intermediaries may provide services in respect of both Accepted Virtual Assets and Digital Securities.  To do so, they must apply to the FSRA to vary its FSP such that it is permitted to extend its licensed operations to Digital Securities (paragraph 5). Specifically, the intermediary must demonstrate its ability to provide the required services and to meet applicable regulatory requirements.  \n\nSecondly, the same applies to Virtual Asset Custodians, which may apply to the FSRA to be a Digital Securities Facility (DSF) in order to provide custody of Digital Securities (paragraph 73). Intermediaries that are planning to extend their services to Digital Securities are expected to comply with specific regulatory considerations, including requirements on Disclosure (DLT Access Implications, custody and transfers) and access to data recorded in Trade Repositories.\n\nAll regulated parties involved are also expected to manage potential conflicts that might arise from any discrepancies between the recorded balances on the previous and new versions of the protocol (\u2018forks\u2019). On hard forks, these parties should ensure that the new Virtual Asset meets the requirements for an Accepted Virtual Asset and that they have notified the FSRA well in advance of offering the Virtual Asset (paragraph 4).\n\nIntermediaries in Digital Securities also should be aware of the existing rules regarding Offers, Issuance & Trading (Specific regulatory considerations apply), Market Regulators' requirements on transactions and notifications in case of significant modifications. Such parties must provide clear disclosures and necessary information about applicable costs, Transfer impacts, especially where the Digital Security transfer costs can exist. Only under FSRA approval would the current regulatory architecture for DLT based traded Virtual Assets also apply for DLT-held Digital Securities.\n\nAny activity that includes clients using any trading-based activity for investments requires intermediaries to closely adhere to relevant market directives for Market Regulation and ensure that where prices are calculated they have not constructed what constitutes as an OTC, they abide by regulatory and trade standards in relation to being able execute an intermediary role to a regulated market if taking prices from such regulated market for determining securities' own listed value.\n\nThirdly, when adapting to the upcoming rules and being approved to operate it is of extreme importance that regulators may also impose additional capital requirements, to accommodate changes with Digital Securities requirements in chapters relevant to \u2018Capital Requirements\u2019 and \u2018SCSF\u2019 for spot commodity.\n\nThey can consider the implications on capital adequacy requirements and the FSRA regulatory capital requirements - especially when entities are operating within a group under the context as is stated, ensuring a consolidated supervision of such entities.\n\nIntermediaries should be aware that only when any hard-fork in the infrastructure technologies underpin the Virtual Asset transactions - are also a scenario that regulators review to consider the risk implications and be updated on any impact on a given activity of a broader financial institution thus enabling authorities to mitigate any effects arising on all capitalisation factors.\n\nThis description outlines various additional activities which we believe highlights challenges that intermediaries continue to operate in as, especially where infrastructure and regulatory concerns need greater vigilance with respect to maintaining and keeping transparent any decision on how these requirements are addressed at any point concerning disclosure of the new virtual asset status."

The Governing Body should comprise an adequate number and mix of individuals with relevant knowledge, skills, and expertise to discharge their duties effectively, and have adequate powers and resources to enable them to do so. \n\nIn cases where the Authorised Person has no regulatory track record, additional corporate governance controls are needed to ensure sound and prudent management, such as the appointment of an independent Director with relevant regulatory experience to the Governing Body. This appointment aims to provide effective oversight and guidance to the business.\n\nMoreover, significant responsibilities must be apportioned between the members of the Governing Body and senior management in a manner that: \n- Meets corporate governance requirements, \n- Is suitable for the nature, scale, and complexity of the business, \n- Enables clear accountability for matter assignment, \n- And allows the business to be adequately monitored and controlled.\n\nThe Authorised Person should maintain a clear apportionment of responsibilities, ensuring that such an arrangement does not compromise sound and prudent management of the business.\n\nFurthermore, a sound framework for managing Credit Risk is expected, where systems and controls are implemented and maintained to promote prudent and sound management. This Credit Risk management should:\n- Be suited to the Authorised Person's operations,\n- Address geographical diversity,\n- Enable effective risk identification, assessment, monitoring, and control,\n- And maintain adequate Capital Resources.\n\nAdditionally, corporate governance practices for interest rate risk management should include:\n- Documentation of the policy and strategy, \n- A system for identifying and assessing Non-Trading Book interest rate risk, \n- Robust methods for measurement and monitoring of Non-Trading Book interest rate risk,\n- And adequate control and management systems to mitigate such risk.\n\nIt is also essential for the Authorised Person to have fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory procedures for pricing Financial Instruments, with a sound corporate governance framework and adequate arrangements to mitigate conflicts of interest in the price reporting process.\n\nIn general, the goal of the Authorised Person should be to achieve compliance with the intended outcomes of section 73 of the FSMR and the Principles, which promote long-term prudent and sound management of the Reporting Entity and its Shareholders. The Authorised Person must illustrate how its actual practices achieve these outcomes in its annual report.\n\nBy implementing and maintaining the above corporate governance measures, an Authorised Person with a small scale operation and a tightly held ownership structure can demonstrate its commitment to sound and prudent management in compliance with regulatory requirements."

        "Answer": "To ensure that an Authorized Person's liquidity risk management is maintained within the prescribed limits and operating procedures, as required by Rule 9.2.1(5), the system in place must meet the following key requirements:\n\n1. The system enables the Authorized Person's Governing Body and senior management to review compliance with limits set in accordance with Rule 9.2.7 and operating procedures. This facilitates ongoing monitoring and ensures that the established limits are adhered to.\n\n2. The system has appropriate approval processes, limits, and other mechanisms designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Authorized Person's Liquidity Risk management processes are adhered to. This implies the implementation of robust controls and procedures to manage liquidity risk effectively.\n\nIn ensuring that these requirements are met, the system should effectively address various risks associated with securitization transactions, if applicable, including:\n\n- The liquidity and capital implications that may arise from items returning to the balance sheet.\n- Operational risks that may arise under a securitization.\n- Reputational risks that may arise as a result of its securitization activities.\n\nMoreover, in managing risks, an Authorized Person should also be cognisant of country risk and transfer risk when granting credit to obligors in other countries. This involves considering the economic and political environment in the relevant countries and its potential impact on the obligors' ability to service the credit.\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk management system is further underscored by Principle 4, which emphasizes the importance of having an adequate, effective, well-defined, and well-integrated risk management, internal control, and compliance framework in place.\n\nIn terms of data management and updates, an Authorized Person should aim to update its data sets daily in line with industry practice. If updates are less frequent, particularly less than once every three months, the Authorized Person should be prepared to demonstrate to the Regulator that market price volatilities are stable. In such cases, compensating controls in the form of stress testing may also be expected by the Regulator.\n\nOverall, the system implemented under Rule 9.2.1(5) is critical in ensuring that an Authorized Person maintains effective liquidity risk management within prescribed limits and operating procedures, thereby contributing to overall financial stability and integrity."

        "Answer": "The application of the Safe Custody Rules has been demonstrated in various scenarios to clarify the expectations and application of these rules for Authorised Persons.\n\nIn one instance, an Authorised Person was required to ensure that their Auditor states in the Safe Custody Auditor's Report the extent to which they were holding and controlling Client Investments, Arranging Custody or Providing Custody, as at the date of their audited statement of financial position. For example, XYZ Securities, a licensed brokerage firm, received a Safe Custody Auditor's Report stating that they were holding Client Investments worth $100 million and providing custody for $500 million in Virtual Assets.\n\nFurthermore, the Safe Custody Auditor's Report must verify whether the Authorised Person has maintained systems and controls to enable compliance with the Safe Custody Rules throughout the year. For instance, ABC Asset Management demonstrated that their systems and controls were sufficient to prevent any material discrepancies in the reconciliation of Safe Custody Investments, meeting the requirements of COBS Chapter 15.\n\nThe Safe Custody Rules also require Authorised Persons to register, record or hold Client Investments in the name of the Client or a Nominee Company. For example, DEF Bank maintained a Client Account in the name of a Nominee Company controlled by the bank, ensuring that Safe Custody Assets were segregated from the bank's own assets.\n\nAuthorised Persons providing custody of Virtual Assets must comply with the Safe Custody Rules in Chapter 15 of COBS, read together with Chapter 17 of COBS. For example, a Virtual Asset Custodian demonstrated that their technology governance and controls were in line with GEN Rule 3.3 and COBS Rule 17.5, ensuring the safe storage and transmission of data and maintaining business continuity planning.\n\nAuthorised Persons must also have systems and controls in place to ensure that they obtain prior written permission from Clients before using their Safe Custody Assets for their own purpose or that of another Person. For instance, a brokerage firm, GHI Securities, obtained written permission from their Clients before using their Safe Custody Assets as collateral for stock lending activities.\n\nThe application of the Safe Custody Rules has demonstrated that Authorised Persons must maintain records of Safe Custody Assets and ensure that equivalent assets are returned to the Client Account of the Client. For example, JKL Asset Management maintained records of all Client Investments and ensured that equivalent assets were returned to the Client Account within the required timeframe.\n\nLastly, Authorised Persons must ensure that Clients are not disadvantaged by the use of their Safe Custody Assets. For instance, MNO Bank ensured that Clients were not subject to any losses or fees when their Safe Custody Assets were used for collateral or stock lending activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of the Safe Custody Rules has demonstrated that Authorised Persons must maintain robust systems and controls to ensure compliance with the Rules, maintain accurate records, and ensure that Clients are not disadvantaged by the use of their Safe Custody Assets."

Connected Counterparties should be identified and the procedures for the management of the combined Credit Risk considered.\").\n\n9. Monitoring and reporting requirements: As a critical part of the Authorised Person's ongoing compliance responsibilities, the Regulator expects the Authorised Person to maintain the ability to monitor, report, and maintain records of the underlying Exposures, including information related to Exposure type, percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due, default rates, prepayment rates, loans in foreclosure, property type, occupancy, and average credit score (Source: Context, \"(h) the Authorised Person has, on an on going basis, a comprehensive understanding of the risk characteristics of its individual securitisation Exposures\").\n\n10. Aggregate Exposure against the same Counterparty or group of Closely Related Counterparties or group of Connected Counterparties: Aggregate Exposure should be performed according to regulatory expectations and compliant documentation maintained (Source: Context, \"(h) aggregate its Exposures to the same Counterparty or group of Closely Related Counterparties or group of Connected Counterparties;\").\n\nThe accurate identification and analysis of beneficial owners of the underlying Exposures provide a basis for effective risk mitigation and maintaining adherence to regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and aggregate Exposure limits. Regular monitoring is critical to ensure that those requirements are being adhered to over time."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, it appears that while the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) does not provide explicit templates or examples of compliant disclosures for Non-Equivalent Estimates, it does offer detailed guidance and rules that can help a Mining Reporting Entity ensure adherence to regulatory standards.\n\nWhen disclosing Non-Equivalent Estimates of Mineralisation, a Mining Reporting Entity must include a prominent, and proximate, statement relating to the lack of appropriate classification work (under a Mining Reporting Standard) and the related uncertainty of further evaluation work (Rule 11.7.4(1)). This is a critical requirement for disclosing material Non-Equivalent Estimates.\n\nTo ensure compliance, a Mining Reporting Entity should follow the guidance provided in the rules and consider the following key aspects:\n\n1. **Non-Equivalent Estimates disclosure requirements**: Provide a fair and balanced representation of the information contained in the report, including a summary of all material information related to the reported estimates of Ore Reserves (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n2. **Classification and confidence**: Explain the criteria used for classification, including the classification of the Mineral Resources on which the Ore Reserves are based and the confidence in the modifying factors applied (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n3. **Material assumptions and outcomes**: Disclose material assumptions and outcomes from the Technical Study, but not including a Scoping Study (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n4. **Sampling techniques and data**: Report on the sampling techniques and data used in the Technical Study (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n5. **Estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves**: Follow the applicable Mining Reporting Standard (e.g., JORC Code or SAMREC Code) for estimating and reporting Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n6. **Explanations for omitted information**: If certain information is not included in the disclosure, provide an explanation for why that information is not material to understanding the estimates of Ore Reserves (Rule 11.7.4(1)).\n\nWhile there are no explicit templates or examples, the ADGM provides guidance through the rules and the use of other relevant standards, such as the JORC Code or SAMREC Code, to help a Mining Reporting Entity ensure compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nIn practice, a Mining Reporting Entity can ensure adherence to regulatory standards by:\n\n* Following the Rules and guidelines provided by the ADGM.\n* Consulting with the ADGM if there are any doubts or concerns about the disclosure requirements.\n* Referring to relevant sections of the Mining Reporting Standard for guidance on the preparation of a report on Ore Reserves.\n* Ensuring that the financial statements have been audited or reviewed by auditors and that the audit or review by the auditor is included within the report.\n\nIn summary, while there are no explicit templates or examples provided by the ADGM, a Mining Reporting Entity can ensure compliance with regulatory standards by following the detailed guidance and rules provided in the regulatory documents and seeking advice from the ADGM if necessary."

However, I must emphasize that the specific details about the exact notification requirements for subsection (1)(b) are not explicitly stated in the given context.\n\nTo infer the most likely procedures and requirements, I will consider the structure and tone of similar regulatory requirements mentioned in the context. Specifically, I will look at the obligation to inform the Regulator of any breach of Rule 2.2. While not directly related to subsection (1)(b), it provides insight into the possible structure of regulatory notification requirements:\n\n1. If we consider the obligation to inform the Regulator of any breach of Rule 2.2 as a basis for comparison, we can assume that the Regulator would require a Captive Insurer to provide timely and accurate information regarding the appointment of an auditor or actuary. \n\n2. According to the context, if a Captive Insurer becomes aware or has reasonable grounds to believe that it is or may be in breach of any provision, it must tell the Regulator orally about the matter immediately but within one Business Day (similar procedures might be reasonably expected for subsection (1)(b)).\n\n3. Subsequently, the Captive Insurer should provide a written notice to the Regulator by no later than the next Business Day, including details about the appointment (nature of the auditor or actuary, their qualifications, terms of office, etc.). This written notice should logically cover necessary information that the Regulator needs to efficiently oversee the activities of the Captive Insurer.\n\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge that without specific guidance or rules, this response is only a reasonable interpretation based on general administrative and regulatory principles.

        "Answer": "To prepare for scenario testing related to potential defaults, an Applicant/Authorised Person should consider the following steps, adhering to the regulatory requirements and guidelines outlined by the FSRA:\n\n1. **Default Rules**: The Applicant/Authorised Person should consider different scenarios/circumstances where it may need to utilise the powers provided to it under its Default Rules, and take appropriate action as required. This may relate to financial and/or technical 'defaults', such as delivery failure, storage failure, or wider banking arrangements.\n\n2. **ICAAP and Stress Testing**: If using an internal capital model, the Authorised Person should validate the assumptions of the model through a comprehensive stress testing programme, which should include:\n   a. testing correlation assumptions (where risks are aggregated) using combined stresses and scenario analyses;\n   b. using stress tests to identify the extent to which the firm's risk models omit non-linear effects, for instance, the behaviour of Derivatives in Market Risk models;\n   c. considering not just the effect of parallel shifts in interest rate curves, but also the effect of the curves becoming steeper or flatter.\n\n3. **Substance Requirements**: The Applicant/Authorised Person must commit resources of a nature allowing it to operate in substance within ADGM, with substantive resources committed across all lines of activity, including commercial, governance, compliance/surveillance, operations, technical, IT, and HR functions. The 'mind and management' of the Authorised Person should be located within ADGM.\n\n4. **Virtual Asset Framework**: The Authorised Person should apply the Rules referenced in COBS Rule 17.1.4 to all transactions undertaken in relation to Virtual Assets, including:\n   a. Suitability (COBS Rule 3.4);\n   b. Best Execution (COBS Rule 6.5);\n   c. Aggregation and Allocation (COBS Rule 6.7);\n   d. Confirmation Notes (COBS Rule 6.10);\n   e. Periodic Statements (COBS Rule 6.11);\n   f. Key Information and Client Agreement (COBS Chapter 12).\n\n5. **Password Protection and Encryption**: The Authorised Person should have clear policies and procedures for recovery in the event that a Client loses access credentials, including the recovery or re-generation of lost private keys (e.g., using a seed phrase if applicable).\n\n6. **Listing Rules**: When issuing Digital Securities, the Issuer should note the listing principles set out in MKT Rule 2.2, which apply in full. The FSRA will generally expect an Issuer of Digital Securities to appoint a Sponsor as required by MKT Rule 5.1.2.\n\n7. **Origin and Destination of Virtual Asset Funds**: The Authorised Person should have clear policies and procedures to identify the source of funds, ensure compliance with COBS Rules 17.5(c) (Origin and destination of Virtual Asset funds) and 17.5(e) (Risk Management), and cover due diligence on deposits and withdrawals by legal persons that represent further multiple deposit-holders or withdrawal recipients of the Virtual Assets.\n\n8. **Custody of Virtual Assets**: The Authorised Person operating as a Virtual Asset Custodian should not permit arrangements whereby just a sole party or signatory is able to completely authorise the movement, transfer, or withdrawal of Accepted Virtual Assets or Client Money held under custody on behalf of Clients. In particular, the Authorised Person should not have custody arrangements whereby only a sole person can fully access the private key or keys for the Accepted Virtual Assets held under custody.\n\n9. **Sustainability**: The Authorised Person should adhere to the principles of sustainability, transparency, and responsible sourcing and supply, as outlined in the ADGM's Sustainable Finance Agenda, and ensure participants can operate in markets that have suitable minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply.\n\n10. **Record Keeping**: The Authorised Person should keep records of the due diligence process it has undertaken to confirm that an asset meets the criteria in Rule \u200e3.8.12 at the time of acquisition and on an ongoing basis.\n\nExample best practices for preparing for scenario testing related to potential defaults may include:\n\n* Regularly reviewing and updating Default Rules to ensure they remain relevant and effective.\n* Conducting comprehensive stress testing programmes to validate internal capital model assumptions.\n* Implementing robust governance and risk management practices to address key person risk and other potential vulnerabilities.\n* Maintaining detailed records of due diligence processes and asset acquisitions.\n* Providing ongoing training and education to employees on scenario testing, risk management, and compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nThe FSRA's specific guidance on these aspects may provide additional insights and best practices for the Applicant/Authorised Person to consider when preparing for scenario testing related to potential defaults."

        "Answer": "For RSF purposes, based on the provided context, the calculation of the Required Stable Funding requires an Authorised Person to include financial instruments, foreign currencies, and commodities for which a purchase order has been executed, and exclude those for which a sales order has been executed. However, the exclusion of sales orders is contingent upon the criteria mentioned in the regulatory documents.\n\nAccording to the context, an Authorised Person should exclude financial instruments, foreign currencies, and commodities for which a sales order has been executed (point (a)(ii)). Nonetheless, this exclusion is subject to the condition that the effects of such transactions be reflected in the balance sheet of the Authorised Person when settled (point (b)(i)). This implies that the exclusion of sales orders should only occur after settlement has occurred.\n\nTherefore, for RSF purposes, sales orders should be excluded from the calculation only after settlement has occurred, rather than from the date they are executed. This approach aligns with the regulatory requirements, ensuring that the effects of such transactions are accurately reflected in the balance sheet of the Authorised Person."

        "Answer": "No, an Authorised Person cannot use a credit assessment that is exclusively available to the parties involved in a specific transaction. This is because the regulatory requirements state that an Authorised Person must only use an external credit assessment which is accessible to the public, and not one that is made available only to the parties to a transaction.\n\nThis requirement is to ensure that the assessment is reliable, impartial, and transparent, as it is based on publicly available information and not limited to information controlled by the parties to the transaction. Furthermore, the regulations emphasize the importance of due diligence on clients and conducting transactions that align with the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.\n\nIn addition to the specific requirement on credit assessments, Authorised Persons are also subject to other regulatory obligations, including:\n\n1. Origin and destination of Virtual Asset funds: Authorised Persons must perform due diligence on clients before opening an account and maintain lists of tainted wallet addresses to identify and report suspicious transactions.\n\n2. Systems and controls: Authorised Persons must establish and maintain systems and controls to manage risks, including the risk of financial crime, and take into account their own risk assessment under Chapters 6 and 7 of the regulations.\n\n3. Transactions in Derivatives: Authorised Persons must provide additional information when conducting transactions in derivatives, including maturity, delivery or expiry date, strike price, and profit or loss to the client.\n\n4. General regulatory requirements: Authorised Persons must comply with the requirements in PRU (Prudential Rulebook) and COBS (Conduct of Business Sourcebook), including rules on suitability, best execution, aggregation and allocation, confirmation notes, periodic statements, and key information and client agreement.\n\n5. Risk assessment and management: Authorised Persons must conduct thorough risk assessments and implement effective risk management systems to mitigate potential risks, including those associated with innovative technologies.\n\n6. Regulatory requirements for new technologies: When using new or developing technologies, such as those associated with Regulated Activities, Authorised Persons must pay specific attention to assessing potential risks, including those related to financial crime.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of credit assessments that are solely available to the parties involved in a specific transaction is not permitted for Authorised Persons, as it does not align with the principles of public accessibility, impartiality, and reliability. Authorised Persons must comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, including those related to due diligence, systems and controls, transactions in derivatives, and risk management, to ensure effective management of risks and adherence to AML/CFT regulations."

However, the ESG Disclosures Framework offers a 'comply or explain' approach, which grants companies flexibility in developing their governance processes and practices.\n\nTo assist in benchmarking their own reporting process, companies may consider the following requirements and procedures:\n\n1. **Maintenance and development of systems:** Authorised Persons should conduct at least annual third-party verification/audit of core systems being used.\n2. **Annual review of infrastructure:** For MTFs using Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Custodians, an annual review of their infrastructure should be undertaken by reputable third-party cyber security consultants.\n3. **Internal review of ESG disclosures reporting process:** An internal review of the ESG disclosures reporting process should be undertaken periodically as part of a company's internal audit framework.\n4. **Annual reporting on compliance:** The annual financial report of a Listed Entity must state whether the best practice standards have been adopted and explain why standards were not fully adopted or partially adopted.\n\nCompanies may also consider the principles for disclosing financial information, which require:\n\n1. **Appropriate qualifications and assumptions:** Financial information should include qualifications and assumptions to prevent it from being misleading or deceptive.\n2. **Consistent financial metrics:** Financial metrics should be consistent and include the basis for calculation.\n3. **Reliability:** Disclosure of financial information should be reliable, considering that it may not have been subject to an audit or audit review.\n\nWhen informing the Registrar of their decision not to submit ESG disclosures, companies should:\n\n1. **Submit correspondence:** Companies should submit correspondence to monitoring@adgm.com, including a description of the reasons for their determination.\n\nIn summary, while the regulatory authority does not explicitly provide templates or examples, companies may consider these requirements and procedures when developing their ESG disclosures reporting process."

For an Authorised Person that is a Credit Rating Agency, maintaining the separation of persons holding appointments under (1)(a) and (c) is crucial. Here is a detailed response to provide guidance on best practices for achieving this separation.\n\n**Separation of Key Roles**\n\n* An Authorised Person that is a Credit Rating Agency must ensure that appointments referred to in (1)(a) and (c) are held by separate persons at all times, to prevent potential conflicts of interest.\n* This separation is essential to maintain objectivity and integrity in the credit rating process, particularly when it involves Employees who participate in, or might otherwise have an effect on, the rating process.\n\n**Guidance for ADGM Credit Rating Agencies**\n\nADGM may offer guidance to Credit Rating Agencies to maintain the separation of key roles by:\n\n* Ensuring the credit rating process is independent from other functions within the organisation.\n* Having separate individuals responsible for rating analysis, credit assessment, and approval.\n* Establishing and documenting clear policies and procedures for credit rating activities.\n* Implementing internal controls to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of the credit rating process.\n\n**ADGM Expectations**\n\nADGM expects Credit Rating Agencies to demonstrate their ability to comply with regulatory requirements, maintain accurate records, and ensure ongoing suitability for listing. The regulator considers various factors, including:\n\n* The Applicant's connection with its controlling Shareholders or any other Person.\n* The Applicant's readiness and ability to comply with its obligations under the FSMR and these Rules.\n* Any matter in relation to the Applicant, its business or Securities which may harm the integrity or the reputation of the ADGM Financial System or which may pose a risk to the Regulator's objectives.\n\n**Best Practices for Credit Rating Agencies**\n\nADGM encourages Credit Rating Agencies to adopt best practices in maintaining the separation of key roles, including:\n\n* Conducting formal and periodic reviews of their remuneration policies and practices.\n* Ensuring Employees involved in the credit rating process are aware of their responsibilities and obligations.\n* Maintaining accurate records of credit rating activities, including audit trails and accounting records.\n* Disclosing any potential conflicts of interest or material information that may affect the credit rating process.\n\n**Enforcement and Disciplinary Actions**\n\nThe Regulator will take enforcement action against any Person, including Relevant Persons, their Senior Management, and Employees, in respect of a breach of any Rule in the AML Rulebook. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in civil liability under section 70 of the FSMR.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADGM provides guidance to Credit Rating Agencies to maintain the separation of key roles to prevent potential conflicts of interest and ensure the integrity of the credit rating process. By adopting best practices and complying with regulatory requirements, Authorised Persons can demonstrate their commitment to maintaining high standards of governance and transparency."

        "Answer": "The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) regulatory framework specifies the criteria for determining a \"practical or legal impediment\" to the prompt transfer of own funds and repayment of liabilities between counterparties. According to the regulations, the primary consideration is whether there are any current or foreseen obstacles that could hinder the timely transfer of funds or repayment of liabilities between counterparties established in the ADGM and those established outside the ADGM.\n\nIn assessing the presence of a practical or legal impediment, the following criteria must be evaluated:\n\n1. **Sound risk management procedures**: The risk management procedures of the counterparties must be adequately sound, robust, and consistent with the level of complexity of the derivative transaction. This implies that the counterparties must have in place effective risk management systems, procedures, and controls to mitigate potential risks.\n2. **Transfer of own funds**: There must be no current or foreseen practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds between the counterparties. This entails evaluating whether there are any restrictions, regulations, or other obstacles that could hinder the transfer of funds between the counterparties.\n3. **Repayment of liabilities**: Similarly, there must be no current or foreseen practical or legal impediment to the repayment of liabilities between the counterparties. This requires assessing whether there are any obstacles, such as regulatory restrictions or contractual covenants, that could prevent or delay the repayment of liabilities.\n4. **Market conditions**: The Regulator may specify market conditions that prevent marking to market and the criteria for using marking to model, which could be relevant in evaluating the presence of a practical or legal impediment.\n5. **Arm's length transactions**: The Regulator may require that transactions with Group members be at arm's length, and for maintenance of 'Chinese walls', as part of the procedures to insulate the Insurer from potentially adverse effects of Group activities.\n\nThe Regulator may also provide further guidance on the applicable criteria for determining a practical or legal impediment, including what should be considered as such an impediment.\n\nIn addition to these criteria, the following are also relevant:\n\n1. **Risk-based assessment**: A Relevant Person must undertake a risk-based assessment of every customer, which includes an assessment of the risks associated with the carrying on of Non-Financial Technology (NFT) business.\n2. **Business risk assessment**: A business risk assessment should include an assessment of the risks associated with the carrying on of NFT business, particularly the use of electronic Know-Your-Customer (eKYC) systems.\n\nOverall, the ADGM regulatory framework emphasizes the importance of robust risk management procedures, timely transfer of own funds, and repayment of liabilities between counterparties. The presence of a practical or legal impediment can be determined by evaluating various factors, including market conditions, arm's length transactions, and risk-based assessments."

Further guidance on the considerations applicable to entities wishing to operate as a DSF are set out in paragraphs 55 \u2013 61 above.  Note, however, that with respect to Authorised Persons currently Operating an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets), the FSRA will require the DSF to be a separate legal/operating entity from those entities it is providing settlement services (MIR Rule 3.8) and/or custody services (MIR Rule 2.10) for.  Migration of an independent Virtual Asset Custodian to being a DSF may therefore likely pose less operational/regulatory issues than an entity currently operating as both an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets) and Virtual Asset Custodian.\n",

Unlike Virtual Assets, which are subject to the FSMR provisions on Misleading Statements and require Authorised Persons to implement suitable policies and procedures to comply with these requirements, Digital Securities issued and traded on DLT platforms are subject to more stringent regulatory oversight.\n\nIn particular, the FSRA expects that Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Digital Securities will have developed and implemented policies and procedures for the sharing of information, including customer account and transaction information, between Group entities, as well as adequate safeguards on the confidentiality and use of such information (a-e). This level of regulatory scrutiny is not explicitly mentioned in the context of Virtual Assets.\n\nFurthermore, the FSRA's approval is required for the implementation of liquidity incentive schemes in the context of Digital Securities, whereas no such requirement is mentioned for Virtual Assets (8.4.3).\n\nIn terms of risk management, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to have a robust Operational Risk management framework commensurate with the nature, scale, and complexity of their operations, including the management of Exposures to Operational Risk, and to hold sufficient regulatory capital against such Exposures (Chapter).\n\nIn addition, the FSRA may impose penalties and administrative fees, and prescribe forms and additional procedures for the imposition and recovery of such penalties, as well as for the enforcement of actions required by the Regulatory Authority (a-b).\n\nFinally, the review process for Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Digital Securities must cover specific areas, including a sample testing of customer documentation, an analysis of Suspicious Activity/Transaction Reports, and a review of the adequacy of the level of responsibility and oversight of the Relevant Person's Governing Body and Senior Management (6).\n\nIn conclusion, the FSRA's expectation of DLT access for Digital Securities issuance and trading is more stringent and comprehensive than the access provided for Virtual Assets like Bitcoin, with a greater emphasis on regulatory oversight, risk management, and internal controls."

This involves regularly assessing the activity in these derivatives to determine whether a particular Class of Derivatives may pose a systemic risk.

This team provides tailored guidance and support to applicants, including understanding the RegLab regulatory framework, preparing their RegLab application, drawing up a risk-appropriate testing parameter, and meeting their ongoing regulatory requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the ADGM emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and risk assessment, including the requirement for Authorised Persons to inform the Regulator as soon as practicable if they no longer comply with any of the requirements or conditions imposed by the Regulator. This ensures that Authorised Persons are held accountable for their actions and are required to take prompt corrective action to rectify any situation that may pose a risk to their business or customers.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADGM's monitoring activities concerning OTC Derivatives that are not eligible for clearing are a critical component of the regulatory framework, aimed at identifying and mitigating potential systemic risks and preventing regulatory arbitrage. The ADGM's oversight and guidance, combined with the requirements for VC Managers and Authorised Persons, ensure that the regulatory framework is robust and effective in protecting investors and the wider financial system."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, it is not acceptable for a fund to use outdated unit prices and currency rates in their valuations. According to the regulations, \"Unit prices and currency rates used in Fund valuations should be up to date and from a reputable source.\" This implies that using outdated prices or rates is not compliant with the regulatory requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the regulations emphasize the importance of reviewing the reliability of the source of prices and rates regularly, and following up on the use of doubtful prices or rates. This suggests that fund managers should exercise diligence in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the unit prices and currency rates used in valuations.\n\nIn addition, the regulations highlight the need for fund managers to take reasonable steps to ensure that third-party providers, including those providing attestations, have the required skills, resources, and experience, and are independent of, and not subject to any conflict of interest with, the fund manager, investment advisor, and trustee.\n\nIn the context of risk management, the regulations require insurers to develop, implement, and maintain a risk management system to identify, assess, monitor, mitigate, and control reinsurance risk, which includes risks associated with the use of reinsurance arrangements.\n\nLastly, the regulations emphasize the importance of periodic internal reviews of the ESG disclosures reporting process as part of a company's internal audit framework, which suggests that fund managers should have a robust process in place to review and update their ESG disclosures reporting.\n\nIn summary, using outdated unit prices and currency rates in fund valuations is not acceptable and contravenes regulatory requirements. Fund managers must ensure that unit prices and currency rates are up to date, from a reputable source, and regularly reviewed, and that they take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of third-party providers, and maintain robust risk management and internal audit processes."

This concept of materiality is in line with the IFRS, which provides guidance on materiality in the context of financial reporting.\n\nWhen assessing materiality, the Regulator considers whether the omitted item is proprietary in nature and the disclosure of the relevant information to the public would undermine the Firm's competitive position or render the Firm's investments in products and systems less valuable. Additionally, the Regulator assesses whether the omitted item is confidential in nature and the disclosure of the relevant information would violate or jeopardise confidentiality agreements with Clients or Counterparties.\n\nIn relation to liquidity risk, the Regulator requires Authorised Persons to provide ongoing assurance about their Liquidity Risk by submitting quarterly LCR calculations, notifying the Regulator of home supervisor assessments, and providing written notifications of any adverse findings, changes in funding strategy, business model, or material potential changes in balance sheet structure.\n\nThe Regulator also expects Authorised Persons to have a well-defined, documented, and deliberate approach for the implementation and upgrade of systems and software, including adequate disclosure of Virtual Asset risks to Clients, taking into account their relevant knowledge, experience, and investment objectives.\n\nFurthermore, the Regulator requires Authorised Persons to hold regulatory capital in fiat form, consistent with MIR Rule 3.2.1, and to comply with Sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions, and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable Sanctions.\n\nIn terms of delivery and/or storage facilities, the Regulator requires Authorised Persons to ensure that such facilities operate under rules and regulations equivalent to those applying in the Abu Dhabi Global Market, comply with applicable laws, adhere to international standards, and have appropriate audit and control arrangements, insurance arrangements, and risk mitigation measures in place.\n\nLastly, the Regulator emphasizes the importance of monitoring the value of security and Collateral at an appropriate frequency, such as marking to market Securities provided as Collateral on a daily basis, to ensure effective risk mitigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Regulator defines and assesses materiality in relation to IFRS, while also considering proprietary and confidential information, and requires Authorised Persons to provide ongoing assurance on liquidity risk, maintain robust systems and controls, comply with sanctions, and ensure effective risk mitigation measures are in place."

This includes considering relevant data protection legislation and contributing to a Group-wide risk assessment to identify and assess money laundering risks.\n\nIn addition, VC Managers should have a corporate governance framework that promotes the sound and prudent management and oversight of their business, protecting the interests of customers and stakeholders. This framework should include policies and procedures for identifying and mitigating business continuity planning risks, such as processes for identifying events that may lead to disruptions, a business continuity plan, and procedures for backing up important data on a regular basis and storing it off-site.\n\nFurthermore, VC Managers should establish systems and controls to ensure their affairs are managed effectively and responsibly, with continuous monitoring and review. This includes implementing technology governance and controls specific to virtual assets, such as those related to virtual asset wallets, private and public keys, origin and destination of virtual asset funds, security, and risk management.\n\nVC Managers should also comply with high standards of corporate governance, including having a risk management system that considers a wide range of relevant scenarios, such as peak historic price volatilities, shifts in market factors, multiple defaults, and simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets.\n\nIn terms of prudential capital requirements, VC Managers should meet the applicable requirements, which vary depending on the Regulated Activities they undertake, such as managing a collective investment fund, advising on investments or credit, or arranging deals in investments. \n\nIn conducting their activities, VC Managers should also comply with data protection obligations, including obtaining necessary consents and ensuring adequate safeguards when transferring personal data to recipients in other jurisdictions.\n\nLastly, VC Managers should comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), customer due diligence, and reporting of suspicious transactions."

According to the regulatory expectations, this adjustment should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position, and it may be in addition to any changes to the value of the position required for financial reporting purposes.\n\nTo achieve this, Authorized Persons should establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating an adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. This implies that the same level of illiquidity should be reflected in the adjustment, regardless of whether the position is marked to market using market prices or observable inputs, third-party valuations, or marked to model.\n\nIn establishing these procedures, Authorized Persons should consider the need for an adjustment to a position's valuation to reflect current illiquidity, taking into account the regulatory requirements for managing risks and ensuring effective management of Operational Risk. This includes regularly monitoring material Exposures to Operational Risk losses, ensuring appropriate reporting mechanisms, and immediately notifying the Regulator of any material Operational Risk event.\n\nFurthermore, Authorized Persons engaged in regulated activities related to Virtual Assets should establish systems and controls to ensure their affairs are managed effectively and responsibly, with a focus on technology governance and controls, such as Virtual Asset Wallets, Private and Public Keys, origin and destination of Virtual Asset funds, Security, and Risk Management.\n\nIn conclusion, the adjustment to a position's valuation for regulatory capital purposes should reflect the same level of illiquidity whether the position is marked to market or marked to model, and Authorized Persons should establish and maintain procedures to calculate this adjustment, taking into account regulatory requirements and risk management principles."

This integration is crucial, as the use of new technologies, such as eKYC Systems, may reduce certain risks but also introduce new ones, like transaction fraud, money laundering, or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation.\n\nIn terms of specific requirements, the Relevant Person should conduct a risk-based assessment of customers, including identifying and assessing their beneficial owners, business relationships, and transactions. This assessment should consider various factors, such as the customer's country of origin, residence, nationality, and place of incorporation or business.\n\nFurthermore, the Relevant Person should implement robust security measures and procedures, including access management, credential changes, and monitoring of IP geo-location, VPN, TOR, or unencrypted web connections.

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question, covering all critical regulatory obligations and avoiding any contradictions:\n\nWhen calculating the Capital Requirement for Gamma risk, an Authorised Person treats net Gamma impacts that are positive by not aggregating them in the calculation. According to the regulatory requirement, only the absolute value of the net Gamma impacts that are negative are aggregated to determine the Capital Requirement for Gamma risk (a). This implies that positive net Gamma impacts are excluded from the aggregation process.\n\nIn other words, when an Authorised Person calculates the net Gamma impact in respect of each underlying Financial Instrument or commodity, they may encounter either positive or negative net Gamma impacts (a). However, only the negative net Gamma impacts are considered in the Capital Requirement calculation, while the positive net Gamma impacts are disregarded.\n\nThis treatment of positive net Gamma impacts is in line with the regulatory requirement, which specifically instructs Authorised Persons to aggregate only the absolute value of the net Gamma impacts that are negative (b). By excluding positive net Gamma impacts from the calculation, Authorised Persons can accurately determine their Capital Requirement for Gamma risk."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, I will provide a comprehensive answer that directly addresses the question.\n\nQuestion: Are there any limitations or conditions under which a Fund Manager might restrict an auditor from making copies of records, or is compliance with Rule 16.3.5(c) absolute, irrespective of the nature of the information?\n\nAnswer: According to Rule 16.3.5(c), a Fund Manager is required to allow the auditor to make copies of any records or information referred to in (b). This implies that compliance with Rule 16.3.5(c) is absolute, and the Fund Manager should not restrict the auditor from making copies of records. However, it is essential to consider the context of the regulations and potential exemptions or limitations that may apply.\n\nIn particular, the Regulator may make Rules permitting the disclosure of information by Specified persons for the purpose of assisting or enabling them to discharge Specified functions under these Regulations or any Rules made under these Regulations (as mentioned in the context). This means that the Fund Manager may need to comply with such Rules and regulations when disclosing information or allowing the auditor to make copies of records.\n\nFurthermore, the context also highlights the importance of sanctions compliance, including Targeted Financial Sanctions, which may impact the Fund Manager's ability to disclose certain information or allow the auditor to make copies of records. In such cases, the Fund Manager should ensure that it complies with applicable Sanctions and establishes effective systems and controls to manage such risks.\n\nAdditionally, the context emphasizes the need for cooperation with auditors and the provision of reasonable assistance, as outlined in Rule 16.3.5. This implies that the Fund Manager should not unreasonably restrict the auditor's access to records or information, and should provide such other assistance as the auditor may reasonably request.\n\nIn conclusion, while compliance with Rule 16.3.5(c) is generally absolute, the Fund Manager should consider the context of the regulations, potential exemptions or limitations, and the need for cooperation with auditors when determining whether to restrict an auditor from making copies of records."

        "Answer": "The specific criteria or indicators used to identify connected counterparties within the context of ADGM regulations involve identifying Authorised Persons that have a combined credit risk exposure. This combined credit risk refers to the aggregate exposure against combined limits, in addition to monitoring the constituent exposures to individual counterparties.\n\nTo identify connected counterparties, Authorised Persons should consider the following indicators:\n\n1. On-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit exposures: The Credit Risk management system should include all credit exposures, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet, to identify connected counterparties.\n2. Loan portfolio classification: Authorised Persons should ensure that their loan portfolio is properly classified, and they have an effective early warning system for problem loans.\n3. Aggregate exposure monitoring: Authorised Persons should monitor and report the aggregate exposure against combined limits, in addition to monitoring the constituent exposures to individual counterparties.\n4. Problem credit identification and management: The Credit Risk management system should include procedures for the identification, management, and provisioning of problem credits.\n\nIn managing the combined credit risk, Authorised Persons should consider the following procedures:\n\n1. Classification of credits: Authorised Persons should have an effective system for classifying credits, including problem credits.\n2. Monitoring and identification of problem credits: Authorised Persons should have an early warning system for problem credits and procedures for monitoring and identifying such credits.\n3. Management of problem credits: Authorised Persons should have procedures for managing problem credits, including provisioning for potential losses.\n4. Aggregate exposure limits: Authorised Persons should set aggregate exposure limits and monitor compliance with these limits.\n\nFurthermore, Authorised Persons should also consider the following regulatory requirements:\n\n1. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT): Authorised Persons should adhere to the FSRA's AML/CFT framework, including UAE AML/CFT Federal Laws, FSRA AML and Sanctions Rules and Guidance, and international best practices such as FATF Recommendations.\n2. Delivery and storage facilities: Authorised Persons should ensure that their delivery and storage facilities operate under rules and regulations equivalent to those applying in ADGM, comply with all applicable laws, and adhere to international standards for storage and delivery mechanisms.\n3. Audit and control arrangements: Authorised Persons should have appropriate audit and control arrangements in place, including inventories, deliveries, and physical infrastructure.\n4. Insurance arrangements: Authorised Persons should have appropriate insurance arrangements in place to cover operational, security, fraud, natural disasters, and other applicable risks.\n\nIn conclusion, identifying connected counterparties and managing combined credit risk within the context of ADGM regulations requires Authorised Persons to consider a range of indicators and procedures, including loan portfolio classification, aggregate exposure monitoring, problem credit identification and management, and compliance with regulatory requirements such as AML/CFT, delivery and storage facilities, audit and control arrangements, and insurance arrangements."

This includes having due regard to technology governance and controls, business continuity planning, and outsourcing arrangements (GEN Rule 3.3 and COBS Rule 17.5).\n\nIslamic Funds are also subject to the same regulatory requirements as conventional Funds in relation to Virtual Assets, including having robust systems and architecture, security measures, and business continuity planning.\n\nFurthermore, Islamic Funds must comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, including the appointment of a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who must report semi-annually to the Governing Body or Senior Management on various AML-related matters (Rule 4.1.1).\n\nFinally, Islamic Funds must also comply with annual reporting requirements, including stating whether best practice standards specified in APP 4 have been adopted, and providing a statement by Directors on the effectiveness of the Corporate Governance framework in promoting compliance with the Corporate Governance Principles (APP 4).\n\nIn summary, Islamic Funds are subject to the same regulatory requirements as conventional Funds under IFR 6, with some exceptions as otherwise provided in the IFR 6. This includes compliance with Capital Requirements, technology governance and controls, AML regulations, and annual reporting requirements."

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer addressing the reporting and reconciliation requirements for Fiat Custodians, especially in instances where the issuance of the related fiat token is conducted by an entity not authorized under paragraph 166(a):\n\nFiat Custodians, providing custody/escrow services solely of a fiat currency and the related fiat token, must comply with certain aspects of the Virtual Asset Framework. Specifically, they are required to demonstrate that the fiat token is backed 1:1 through more frequent (weekly) reconciliations and that the Accepted Virtual Asset and Technology Governance requirements are met in relation to the related fiat token.\n\nIn cases where the issuer of the related fiat token is not authorized under paragraph 166(a), the Fiat Custodian is expected to undertake the same due diligence as that would normally apply for an Authorized Person. This includes determining the Accepted Virtual Assets it proposes to use, focusing on Technology Governance requirements, the seven factors used to determine an Accepted Virtual Asset, and requirements relating to reporting and reconciliation.\n\nRegarding reporting obligations, Fiat Custodians may need to consider, among other things, reporting requirements under FATCA, as set out in the Guidance Notes on the requirements of the Intergovernmental Agreement between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, issued by the UAE Ministry of Finance in 2015 and as amended from time to time. Additionally, they may need to comply with Common Reporting Standards, set out in the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017.\n\nFurthermore, Fiat Custodians may need to notify the Regulator of certain events, such as the appointment of an independent Shari'a Supervisory Board to evaluate the Shari'a compliance of the Islamic equity Securities on an annual basis, or any proposed decision with regard to any change in its board of directors or Shari'a Supervisory Board.\n\nIn terms of reconciliation requirements, Fiat Custodians must ensure that they can demonstrate that the fiat token is backed 1:1 through more frequent (weekly) reconciliations. This involves maintaining accurate and up-to-date records of the fiat currency and related fiat token holdings, as well as performing regular reconciliations to ensure that the fiat token is fully backed by the underlying fiat currency.\n\nOverall, Fiat Custodians must ensure that they comply with all relevant reporting and reconciliation requirements, whether under the Virtual Asset Framework, FATCA, Common Reporting Standards, or other applicable regulations. This includes maintaining accurate records, performing regular reconciliations, and notifying the Regulator of certain events, to ensure the integrity and stability of their operations."

        "Answer": "To calculate the capital requirement for maturity mismatches, an Authorized Person should follow Section 4.13, which states that when exposures being hedged have different maturities, the longest maturity must be used. This means that the Authorized Person should identify the longest maturity among the exposures being hedged and use that maturity to determine the capital requirement.\n\nFor example, suppose an Authorized Person has two exposures with different maturities, one with a maturity of 3 years and another with a maturity of 5 years. In this case, the Authorized Person should use the longest maturity of 5 years to calculate the capital requirement for the maturity mismatch.\n\nWhen applying the longest maturity rule in practice, an Authorized Person should:\n\n1. Identify the exposures being hedged and their respective maturities.\n2. Determine the longest maturity among the exposures being hedged.\n3. Use the longest maturity to calculate the capital requirement for the maturity mismatch in accordance with Section 4.13.\n\nIn addition to calculating the capital requirement, an Authorized Person should also have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure that it has adequate capital resources to meet the requirements in Part 4 on capital adequacy at all times. This includes maintaining systems and controls that enable the Authorized Person to demonstrate its compliance with the capital adequacy requirements and to inform the Regulator immediately if it is not likely to be able to satisfy the requirements in future.\n\nFurthermore, an Authorized Person should ensure that its systems and controls are designed to address the risks associated with maturity mismatches, including the risk of not having adequate capital resources to meet the requirements. This includes having processes and procedures in place for managing personnel and decision-making by qualified staff, as well as procedures for the creation and management of services, interfaces, and channels provided by or to third parties.\n\nIn summary, to calculate the capital requirement for maturity mismatches, an Authorized Person should follow Section 4.13, identify the longest maturity among the exposures being hedged, and use that maturity to determine the capital requirement. Additionally, the Authorized Person should have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure that it has adequate capital resources to meet the requirements in Part 4 on capital adequacy at all times, and to address the risks associated with maturity mismatches."

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question, covering all critical regulatory obligations and avoiding any contradictions:\n\nIf an insurer encounters a situation where the duration of assets or liabilities precludes a matched expected payment profile, the financial assumption suggested by this section to be in line with regulatory expectations is to assume a discount rate regarded as consistent with the intention of this section.\n\nThis is in alignment with the regulatory requirement for internal reporting, which ensures that the insurer can satisfy itself that its business is being managed according to sound business principles and can meet its financial commitments as they fall due (Internal Reporting, (b)).\n\nThe insurer must also have arrangements in place to ensure that its assets are properly managed and safeguarded (Internal Reporting, (f)), which includes having a well-documented assessment and management system for operational risk with clear responsibilities assigned for this system (Operational Risk).\n\nFurthermore, the insurer must ensure that its systems and controls make provision to enable the Compliance Officer to have unrestricted access to reports and recommendations and to promptly act upon and remedy any matter identified and reported (Fund Manager, (a) and (b)).\n\nIn addition, the insurer must comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, including anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism), and ensure that its employees involved in the provision of credit ratings have reporting lines and remuneration arrangements that are designed to eliminate, or effectively manage, actual and potential conflicts of interest (Credit Rating Agency).\n\nOverall, the insurer must ensure that it has a thorough understanding of the risks associated with its assets and liabilities and takes appropriate steps to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, including the risk of financial crime (eKYC System, (a) and (d))."
