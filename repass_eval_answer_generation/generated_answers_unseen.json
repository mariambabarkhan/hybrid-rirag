        "Answer": "To determine if a Captive Insurer is effectively engaging in Contracts of Insurance, particularly in relation to Captive Cells or Long-Term Insurance Funds, the FSRA will consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Withdrawal of permission**: If the FSRA withdraws a Captive Insurer's permission to effect Contracts of Insurance, the Captive Insurer must provide a written run-off plan within 28 days, detailing how it will manage the existing insurance business (Rule 10.2.2).\n\n2. **Restriction on new business**: A Captive Insurer that has provided notice to the FSRA cannot effect new Contracts of Insurance in that Class of Business without written permission from the FSRA (Rule 10.2.2).\n\n3. **Captive Cells and Long-Term Insurance Funds**: Where a Captive Insurer carries on Long-Term Insurance Business through a Captive Cell, it must either establish one or more Long-Term Insurance Funds or notify the FSRA that the Captive Cell constitutes a single Long-Term Insurance Fund (Rule 8.2).\n\n4. **Effective management of insurance business**: The FSRA will assess whether the Captive Insurer has implemented policies and procedures for sharing information between Group entities, including information related to customer due diligence and money laundering risks (Section on Group Entities).\n\n5. **Disclosure and reporting requirements**: The Captive Insurer must comply with disclosure requirements, such as submitting audited financial statements and audit reports annually, demonstrating the ability to meet liabilities, and ensuring VC Funds are subject to annual audit requirements (GEN Rule 6.6, GEN Rules 2.2.4 and 5.2.8, and Chapter 16 of FUNDS).\n\n6. **Capital requirements and exemptions**: If the Captive Insurer is a VC Manager, it will not be required to maintain Base Capital Requirement or Expenditure-Based Capital Minimum on an on-going basis, but must disclose this exemption to clients and still comply with other financial and audit requirements (Chapter 3 of PRU).\n\n7. **Compliance with governance standards**: The Captive Insurer must demonstrate compliance with corporate governance standards, including those related to risk management, internal controls, and audit requirements (Section on Trust Service Providers).\n\n8. **Monitoring and control of exposures**: The Captive Insurer must monitor and control its exposures funded by PSIAs on a daily basis, ensuring they remain within concentration risk limits, and notify the FSRA immediately in case of a breach (IFR 5.4.15).\n\nBy evaluating these factors, the FSRA can determine whether a Captive Insurer is effectively engaging in Contracts of Insurance, particularly in relation to Captive Cells or Long-Term Insurance Funds."

Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to \u2018Market Disclosure\u2019 or otherwise known as its \u2018continuous disclosure\u2019 framework.  This Guidance sets out the Listing Authority\u2019s expectations in relation to its continuous disclosure framework, and provides guidance to Reporting Entities to assist their decision making in relation to their continuous disclosure obligations.\n",

This approach is consistent with the expectation set out in Rule 20.2.3, where a Fund Manager should consider not only the investment in the immediate asset but also any underlying assets.\n\n**Information Sharing and Confidentiality**\n\nIn enforcing compliance, ADGM may request or require information from relevant persons, overriding any contractual or other confidentiality obligations (Section [contractual or other requirement imposed on a person (\"P\") to keep any information in confidence]). The Regulator must approve such requests or requirements before they are made or imposed.\n\n**Annual Reporting**\n\nFunds operating in the ADGM must submit annual reports containing specific information, including audited financial statements, auditor reports, and Fund Manager reports (Rule 16.3.8, 16.4.7, and 16.4.8). This reporting helps ADGM monitor compliance with tax reporting regulations.\n\n**Oversight and Internal Controls**\n\nSenior management of Authorised Persons are expected to oversee the development and maintenance of procedures and practices that ensure compliance with tax reporting regulations, including establishing effective internal controls and management information systems (Rule 9.2.2).\n\n**Outsourcing and Cooperation**\n\nAuthorised Persons must ensure that their outsourcing contracts with service providers allow for the provision of information and access to business premises, as well as cooperating with the Regulator in an open and transparent manner (Rule 8.1).\n\nBy enforcing these regulatory requirements, ADGM ensures that Authorised Persons operating in the ADGM comply with tax reporting regulations for non-traditional or emerging virtual assets, even if they do not fit into existing categories."

Further clarity on FSRA\u2019s regulatory position in relation to stablecoins is set out in paragraphs 162 \u2013 166 of the Virtual Assets Guidance.  For RIEs or MTFs trading in Digital Securities, the FSRA\u2019s expectation is that paragraph 166d of the Virtual Assets Guidance (where an infrastructure is using its own fiat tokens as a payment/transaction mechanism solely within its own platform/ecosystem) is likely to be the only scenario for the use of stablecoins by a RIE or MTF trading in Digital Securities.  Where Applicants consider that there are other business use cases for stablecoins (particularly when used by a RIE, MTF or DSF), these would need to be raised (in writing, and for discussion) with the FSRA.\n\n",
            "Chapter \u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

Public keys, on the other hand, can be shared publicly, but must be linked to the correct private key to ensure the secure transfer of Virtual Assets.\n\n**Regular Review and Risk Assessment**\n\nAuthorised Persons must conduct regular reviews of their key management procedures and risk assessments to ensure they are proportionate to the risks associated with Virtual Assets. This includes assessing the risk of key compromise, loss, or theft, and implementing appropriate mitigating measures (Chapter 5, Risk-Based Approach).\n\n**Customer Due Diligence**\n\nAuthorised Persons must also perform Customer Due Diligence (CDD) on clients who use their wallet services, including verifying their identity and assessing the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing (Chapter 8, Customer Due Diligence).\n\n**Transaction Monitoring and Anti-Fraud Measures**\n\nAuthorised Persons must implement effective transaction monitoring and anti-fraud measures to detect and prevent suspicious activity, including the misuse of private keys (Chapter 7, Ongoing Customer Due Diligence).\n\n**Compliance with AML Rulebook and Sanctions**\n\nAuthorised Persons must comply with the AML Rulebook, including the requirements for Sanctions compliance, and establish effective systems and controls to comply with applicable Sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions (Chapter 11, Sanctions).\n\n**Reporting and Disclosure**\n\nAuthorised Persons must report any instances of incorrect pricing or key compromise to the Regulator forthwith, and disclose any relevant information to clients and counterparties as required by the Rules (Rule 5.4.11, Reporting and Disclosure).\n\nBy implementing these measures, Authorised Persons can ensure the secure management of Private and Public Keys, comply with the FSRA's regulatory requirements, and mitigate the risks associated with Virtual Assets."

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer to the question:\n\nWhen categorizing employees based on their involvement with customers, a client relationship manager at a wealth management firm would be considered a client-facing employee, whereas an employee in charge of account setup would not be client-facing.\n\nThis categorization is based on the fact that the client relationship manager is employed by an Authorised Person providing wealth management services and is considered to be providing Regulated Activities to a Customer (Example of an Employee providing Regulated Activities to a Customer, as mentioned in the context). On the other hand, the employee responsible for setting up Client Accounts is not considered client-facing, as they are employed in the back office of an Authorised Person and do not have direct interaction with customers.\n\nIn terms of regulatory obligations, the client relationship manager, as a client-facing employee, would be subject to the Client Money provisions in COBS, which require the firm to ensure that Client Money is protected and segregated from the firm's own assets. The firm would also need to ensure that the client relationship manager is aware of and complies with these provisions.\n\nIn contrast, the employee responsible for setting up Client Accounts would not be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight and would not be considered to be providing Regulated Activities to a Customer.\n\nOverall, the categorization of employees based on their involvement with customers is critical in determining the level of regulatory oversight and compliance required, and firms must ensure that they have adequate procedures and controls in place to protect Client Money and comply with relevant regulations."

The Board should also keep in touch with Shareholder opinion and use its website as a forum for posting information (Source: \"Regulatory Requirements for Authorised Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets\").\n\n6. **Systems and Controls**: The MTF must have appropriate systems and controls in place to demonstrate compliance with the requirements applicable to it, including those set out in the FSMR and these Rules (Source: \"Regulatory Requirements for Authorised Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets\").\n\n7. **Clearing and Collateral Management**: The MTF should ensure that its Recognised Clearing House sets and enforces appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits, and has appropriate collateral risk management procedures in place (Source: \"Regulatory Requirements for Authorised Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in Relation to Virtual Assets\").\n\nBy following these regulatory requirements and procedures, an existing Virtual Asset MTF can extend its regulated activities to include Digital Securities and ensure compliance with the FSRA's requirements."

This implies that the Authorised Person must demonstrate that it can meet the regulatory requirements, including having suitable controls in place, such as identity and transaction monitoring, for the specific Virtual Asset.\n\nFurthermore, the FSRA's fitness and propriety requirements for Authorised Persons, as outlined in GEN 3 \u2013 Management, Systems and Controls and Principle 3, must be adhered to. This includes maintaining accurate and up-to-date information on business partners, conducting ongoing due diligence, and implementing policies and procedures for risk management, compliance, and AML/TFS.\n\nAdditionally, Authorised Persons must calculate their Risk Capital Requirement, which includes Credit Risk Capital Requirement, Market Risk Capital Requirement, Operational Risk Capital Requirement, Displaced Commercial Risk Capital Requirement, and CVA Risk Capital Requirement. This ensures that Authorised Persons have sufficient capital to cover potential risks associated with the Virtual Asset.\n\nMoreover, Authorised Persons in Category 1, 2, or 5 that are members of a Group must establish and maintain systems and controls for monitoring the effect of their relationship with other Group members, compliance with Financial Group supervision requirements, funding within the Group, and compliance with Financial Group reporting requirements.\n\nIn the context of Virtual Assets, Authorised Persons must also maintain a clear and comprehensive audit trail for system issues, including security issues and those with third parties, their resolution, and implementation of fixes.\n\nIn conclusion, the commonalities among Accepted Virtual Assets that have been deemed suitable for use by multiple Authorised Persons include meeting the regulatory requirements for the specific asset, adhering to fitness and propriety requirements, calculating Risk Capital Requirement, establishing and maintaining systems and controls for Group members, and maintaining a clear audit trail for system issues. These commonalities can serve as a benchmark for other Authorised Persons seeking approval for similar assets."

        "Answer": "Here is a comprehensive response that addresses how the outcomes of the business risk assessment, as mandated in Chapter 6, should influence and integrate into the individual customer risk assessments under Chapter 7:\n\nWhen conducting a customer risk assessment under Chapter 7, the outcomes of the business risk assessment undertaken in Chapter 6 should be taken into account and integrated into the assessment process. This is because the risk-based approach (RBA) requires a dynamic process involving regular review and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. \n\nIn particular, the Chapter 6 business risk assessment should inform the identification, assessment, and consideration of the customer's risk profile, including factors such as the customer and any beneficial owners, the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, and the nature of the customer's business (Chapter 7.1.1(1)(a)-(c)). \n\nThe business risk assessment outcomes should also influence the consideration of other customer risk factors, including the customer's country of origin, residence, nationality, place of incorporation or place of business, and the relevant product, service or transaction (Chapter 7.1.1(1)(d)-(e)). \n\nMoreover, the business risk assessment should inform the consideration of the nature, ownership, and control structure of the customer, its beneficial ownership, and its business (Chapter 7.1.1(1)(c)). \n\nThe outcomes of the business risk assessment should also be taken into account when considering the risk of financial crime, including money laundering and terrorist financing, associated with the customer and the business relationship (Chapter 7). \n\nIn addition, the business risk assessment should inform the design and implementation of systems and controls that are appropriate to the Relevant Person's business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks."

This is achieved by implementing a credit risk policy that is consistent with the approved credit risk strategy, considering factors such as risk tolerance, capital allocation, business strategy, and market conditions (Credit Risk policy).\n\nThe Credit Risk policy must provide sound and well-defined credit risk norms and criteria for approving credit applications, clearly specifying exposure limits, product types, business segments, target borrowers, and the nature of credit risk to be incurred (Credit Risk policy). The policy should also include minimum information required for processing credit applications, well-defined criteria for approving new exposures, and effective credit administration policies for ongoing monitoring and management of exposures (Credit Risk policy).\n\nIn addition, the Credit Risk policy should incorporate comprehensive policies for reporting exposures on an ongoing basis, identifying and managing problem assets, and provisioning for loans (Credit Risk policy). The policy should also set out limits and approval processes for credit facilities, ensuring that the Governing Body retains responsibility for governance and that senior management or a designated body approves major credit risk exposures (Credit Risk policy).\n\nThe Authorised Person should carefully manage and avoid excessive risk concentrations, including exposure to individual borrowers, groups of borrowers with similar characteristics, and types of lending with similar characteristics (Risk control). The Credit Risk management system should also ensure that the Authorised Person's risk management systems are appropriate to its size, mix of business, and complexity of operations, addressing all material risks and integrating risk management with its business and operations (Insurer's risk management systems).\n\nUltimately, the Credit Risk management system should enable the Authorised Person to meet its capital requirements by effectively managing and mitigating credit risk exposures, ensuring the stability and soundness of its operations."

This risk management framework should consider the impact of default scenarios, such as delivery failure or storage failure, on the ability to fulfil delivery obligations.\n\n**Principle-based approach:**\nThe FSRA emphasizes a principle-based approach to oversight and responsibility for climate-related financial risk exposures, requiring boards and senior management to have an appropriate understanding of these risks and their potential impact.\n\n**Independent valuation and net present value assessment:**\nIn assessing whether Shareholders and creditors would have received better treatment if an Institution in Resolution had been Wound Up under Insolvency Proceedings, the Regulator may appoint an independent valuer to carry out a valuation as soon as practicable after the application of a Resolution Action. This valuation should consider the net present value of expected future receipts using a gross redemption yield of a portfolio of AAA Rated sovereign risk securities with a similar expected payment profile to the asset being measured.\n\n**Withdrawal of Financial Services Permission:**\nWhen considering requests for the withdrawal of a Financial Services Permission, a firm must demonstrate that it has made appropriate arrangements with respect to its existing customers, including receipt of customer consent where required, and resolution of matters such as business runoff, deposit returns, and asset returns.\n\n**Investment Trust creation:**\nAn Investment Trust shall be created by a Trust Deed entered into between an Authorised Person with a Financial Services Permission to manage a Collective Investment Fund and an Authorised Person with a Financial Services Permission to act as the Trustee of an Investment Trust.\n\n**Countercyclical Capital Buffer requirement:**\nThe Countercyclical Capital Buffer requirement applies on both a solo and consolidated basis for Authorised Persons forming part of Financial Groups.\n\nIn summary, while there is no specific format or template required for inside information disclosure, Reporting Entities must ensure that all pertinent information is communicated in a timely and effective manner, aligned with other regulatory obligations and risk management considerations."

Specifically, the Regulator may take steps that include withdrawal of authorisation as a consequence of the breach. This is because the Regulator has powers of supervision and enforcement over Authorised Persons, including Representative Offices, under the FSMR. Furthermore, the Representative Office is obligated to notify the Regulator as soon as reasonably practical of any breach of a Rule or provision of Regulations or Rules, which would likely trigger an investigation and potential enforcement action by the Regulator.

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that addresses the question and aligns with the regulatory requirements mentioned in the context:\n\nReporting suspected or actual market abuse, financial crime, or money laundering to the regulator involves adhering to specific protocols and formats. According to the FSRA guidance, a Recognised Body must immediately report, in writing, to the Regulator any suspected or actual Market Abuse, Financial Crime, or money laundering on and through the Recognised Body's facilities (Specific FSRA Guidance on the Virtual Asset Framework, page 10). The report should include full details of the information.\n\nThere is no specific format or template mentioned in the provided regulatory documents for reporting suspected or actual market abuse, financial crime, or money laundering. However, it is essential to ensure that the report provides comprehensive and detailed information about the suspected or actual incident, including the nature of the incident, the parties involved, and any relevant evidence or supporting documentation.\n\nIn terms of protocols, the Recognised Body should operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor, deter, and prevent conduct that may amount to Market Abuse, Financial Crime, and money laundering on and through the Recognised Body's facilities (Specific FSRA Guidance on the Virtual Asset Framework, page 10). This includes having appropriate measures in place to detect and report suspicious transactions, as well as implementing robust governance arrangements, risk management, compliance, and internal audit functions.\n\nAdditionally, the FSRA emphasizes the importance of robust governance arrangements, including the fitness and integrity of all controllers, directors, and senior management (Regulatory Requirements for Authorised Persons Engaged in Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets, page 2). This includes ensuring adequate segregation of duties, clear reporting lines, and appropriate oversight arrangements.\n\nIn terms of data protection, Authorised Persons must comply with data protection obligations when transferring personal data to recipients, including cloud-based services or remote servers located in jurisdictions with inadequate safeguards (Specific FSRA Guidance on the Virtual Asset Framework, page 12). This includes obtaining individual consent, ensuring the transfer is necessary for the performance of the service, and entering into approved agreements concerning the protection of personal data.\n\nOverall, reporting suspected or actual market abuse, financial crime, or money laundering to the regulator requires a comprehensive approach that involves robust governance arrangements, effective market surveillance, and adherence to data protection obligations. While there is no specific format or template mentioned in the regulatory documents, it is essential to provide detailed and comprehensive information about the suspected or actual incident to the Regulator."

However, the calculation of the Credit Risk Capital Requirement may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nAdditionally, Authorized Persons providing custody of virtual assets must also consider the safe custody of clients' virtual assets, including sending statements of a client's accepted virtual assets holdings to retail clients at least monthly and carrying out reconciliations of a client's accepted virtual asset holdings at least every week (COBS Rule 15.8.1(a) and COBS Rule 15.9.1).\n\nFurthermore, Authorized Persons in Category 2 or 3A must establish and maintain a senior management structure to manage Liquidity Risk, identify, assess, mitigate, control, and monitor Liquidity Risk, and monitor the Authorized Person's overall Liquidity Risk profile on a regular basis (Regulations imposed on Authorized Persons in Category 2 or 3A).\n\nOverall, Authorized Persons must ensure that they comply with all relevant regulatory requirements and guidelines when recognizing and treating credit risk mitigations for off-balance sheet exposures, and must maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable Sanctions and AML/CFT regulations."

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nThe ADGM can provide clarification on how Rule 6.4.1 complements the General Rulebook (GEN) regarding operational risk matters. Specifically, Rule 6.4.1 requires Authorised Persons to establish and maintain reporting mechanisms that specifically address operational risk matters, which complements the GEN rules that set out the Regulator's requirements on outsourcing by Authorised Persons.\n\nIn particular, Rule 6.4.1 is intended to ensure that Authorised Persons have in place robust operational risk management systems to identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks associated with outsourcing arrangements. This includes establishing and maintaining reporting mechanisms that provide timely and accurate information on operational risk matters, which is essential for effective risk management and compliance with the GEN rules.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 6.4.1 interacts with other regulatory requirements, such as the continuous disclosure obligations under Rule 7.2.1, which operates closely with periodic/financial disclosure obligations and general disclosure obligations under FSMR, ADGM Commercial Laws, and international commercial and corporate laws. This ensures that Authorised Persons provide transparent and timely disclosure of operational risk matters to the Regulator and other stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Principle 3 of the ADGM's regulatory framework emphasizes the importance of preventing money laundering and other financial crime, which is relevant to operational risk management. Authorised Persons are expected to be fully cognisant of applicable reporting obligations under the FATCA and Common Reporting Standards regimes, which is critical for effective operational risk management.\n\nThe Internal Risk Assessment Process (IRAP) is another key requirement that complements Rule 6.4.1. Authorised Persons are required to carry out an IRAP that is proportionate to their nature, size, and complexity of business activities and risk profile. The IRAP provides a comprehensive internal risk evaluation that helps Authorised Persons identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks, including those associated with outsourcing arrangements.\n\nMoreover, Authorised Persons conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets must comply with all requirements applicable to Authorised Persons, including those related to operational risk management. This includes compliance with the Conduct of Business Rulebook (COBS), General Rulebook (GEN), Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Rules and Guidance (AML), Islamic Finance Rules (IFR), and Code of Market Conduct (CMC).\n\nFinally, Market Abuse / Market Surveillance requirements for Spot Commodity Activities also complement Rule 6.4.1. MTFs are required to operate an effective market surveillance program to identify, monitor, detect, and prevent conduct amounting to market misconduct and/or Financial Crime, which is critical for effective operational risk management.\n\nIn conclusion, Rule 6.4.1 complements the GEN rules by requiring Authorised Persons to establish and maintain reporting mechanisms that address operational risk matters, which is critical for effective risk management and compliance with various regulatory requirements."

This includes contributing to a Group-wide risk assessment to identify and assess money laundering risks for the Group.\n\n**AML/TFS Obligations**: The VC Manager must have developed and implemented policies and procedures for the sharing of information between Group entities, including the sharing of information relating to CDD and money laundering risks. The VC Manager must also ensure that it has in place adequate safeguards on the confidentiality and use of information exchanged between Group entities, including consideration of relevant data protection legislation.\n\n**Reporting Obligations**: The VC Manager must ensure that it provides its Group-wide compliance, audit, and AML/TFS functions with customer account and transaction information from its Branches and Subsidiaries when necessary for AML/TFS purposes.\n\n**Disclosure Requirements**: The VC Manager must prominently disclose to prospective Unitholders in the Prospectus and any other financial promotions relating to the Fund, the Mandatory Fund Disclosure Statement, which includes warnings about the risks of investing in high-risk investments.\n\n**Recovery Plan**: In the event of a failure to submit a revised Recovery Plan within the specified timeframe, or if the Regulator determines that a matter notified under subsection (4) has not been adequately addressed in the revised Recovery Plan, the Regulator may direct the Institution to take any measures it considers to be necessary and proportionate, including reducing the risk profile of the Institution or Group, undertaking timely recapitalization, reviewing its strategy and structure, changing its funding strategy, or changing its governance or Subsidiary structure.\n\n**Information to be Supplied**: The VC Manager must be prepared to supply the Regulator with detailed information about its organizational structure, critical operations, Core Business Lines, and liabilities, as well as its risk management practices, hedging strategies, and booking practices, among other things.\n\nIn summary, the VC Manager is required to comply with various regulatory obligations when managing VC Funds invested in high-risk investments, including risk assessment and management, AML/TFS obligations, reporting obligations, disclosure requirements, and recovery plan requirements."

        "Answer": "When dealing with insolvency, an account holding a group of Clients' or Indirect Clients' assets at a Remote Clearing House cannot be consolidated with positions and assets from another account for the purpose of setting off. This is because the Recognised Clearing House is required to segregate and maintain separate accounts for each Client, with clear identification of assets and positions belonging to each Client (Source: (c) among others).\n\nThe Recognised Clearing House's systems and controls must provide for segregation and portability arrangements that effectively protect the positions and related collateral of the Clients of the Members or other participants on its facilities, from the default or insolvency of the relevant Member or other participants (Source: (a)). Furthermore, the Recognised Clearing House must have a clear method for identifying a default, including any automatic or discretionary default scenarios, and how the discretion is exercised in any discretionary default scenarios (Source: (b)).\n\nIn the event of a default, the Recognised Clearing House's Default Rules must clearly define and specify the circumstances that constitute a default, the method for identifying a default, the treatment of proprietary and Client transactions and accounts, the sequencing of actions that the Recognised Clearing House may take, and the roles, obligations, and responsibilities of various parties (Source: (a) to (j)).\n\nAdditionally, the Recognised Clearing House must have a resolution regime in place to contain the impact of a default, which may include a default contribution fund and/or the porting or transferring of open positions and margin related to Client transactions to a non-defaulting participant, receiver, third party, or bridge financial company (Source: (j)(i) and (j)(ii)).\n\nIn terms of insolvency, the Recognised Clearing House must ensure that losses arising from the default of a Member or other participant are allocated in a way that ensures the Recognised Clearing House can continue to provide its services and carry on its activities (Source: (n)).\n\nIt is worth noting that the FSRA has specific requirements for the experience and qualifications of key personnel, including the Senior Executive Officer, Licensed Director, Senior Managers, and Compliance Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer, to ensure that they have the necessary expertise to deal with Retail Clients and comply with regulatory requirements (Source: a) to d)).\n\nIn summary, when dealing with insolvency, a Recognised Clearing House cannot consolidate accounts for the purpose of setting off, and must instead follow its Default Rules and segregation and portability arrangements to protect Client positions and related collateral. The Recognised Clearing House must also have a clear resolution regime in place to contain the impact of a default and ensure its continued operations."

The fact that the Listing Authority has discussed the matter with the Reporting Entity, sent the MAQ Letter and a Trading Halt or Suspension has not been applied for (either before or shortly after Disclosure by the Listing Authority of the MAQ Letter), is likely to create an expectation in the market that there is no Inside Information to be Disclosed.

If through subsequent internal discussions, the information of which the Reporting Entity is aware of changes, or the view of the Reporting Entity changes in relation to the information becoming Inside Information, then action may have to be taken by the Reporting Entity.

The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7.

        "Answer": "The exemptions from appointment requirements for Venture Capital Fund Managers are outlined in Rule A4.11 of the PRU. According to this rule, Venture Capital Fund Managers are exempt from certain appointment requirements, subject to specific conditions being met. \n\nThe rationale behind these exemptions is to provide flexibility and proportionality in the regulation of Venture Capital Fund Managers, acknowledging that these managers may have unique business models and risk profiles that do not warrant the same level of regulatory scrutiny as other financial institutions.\n\nOne of the key conditions for exemption is that the Venture Capital Fund Manager must ensure that its PSIA holdings do not pose a significant Concentration Risk to the Authorised Person. This is achieved by complying with the Large Exposure limits set by the Regulator for Unrestricted PSIAs.\n\nAdditionally, Venture Capital Fund Managers must also comply with other regulatory requirements, such as the risk-based approach outlined in Chapter 5 of the AML Rulebook, which requires a dynamic risk assessment of their business and customers. This includes implementing reasonable and proportionate systems and controls to mitigate money laundering risks.\n\nMoreover, Venture Capital Fund Managers must also comply with the disclosure obligations outlined in the FSMR, including the requirement to disclose Inside Information immediately upon becoming aware of it. This includes information generated by third parties, such as regulatory bodies or industry-specific authorities.\n\nFurthermore, Venture Capital Fund Managers engaged in regulated activities in relation to Virtual Assets must comply with the additional regulatory requirements outlined in the relevant chapter. This includes performing due diligence on clients, maintaining lists of tainted wallet addresses, and complying with the Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.\n\nIn summary, the exemptions from appointment requirements for Venture Capital Fund Managers are conditional upon compliance with specific regulatory requirements, including Concentration Risk limits, risk-based approach, disclosure obligations, and Virtual Asset-specific regulations. The rationale behind these exemptions is to provide a proportionate and flexible regulatory approach that takes into account the unique characteristics and risk profiles of Venture Capital Fund Managers."

Alternatively, if there is no such matter, they must notify the Regulator of this fact.\n\n**Matters to be Notified**\n\nSome examples of matters that may require notification to the Regulator upon ceasing to act include:\n\n* Any risks associated with Financial Crime that may arise from the use of innovative technologies, such as eKYC Systems or NFTF business, which may increase the risk of transaction fraud, money laundering, or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation.\n* Any contravention of FSMR or Rules, or failure to disclose information to the Regulator, which may result in loss to customers, damage to the reputation of the ADGM, or an increased risk that a firm may be used for the purposes of financial crime.\n* Any action taken to remedy a contravention, or disciplinary action taken (or to be taken) by a relevant professional body.\n* Any factors that may affect the risk assessment of a customer, such as the nature and seriousness of any contravention, the effect of the contravention, and the previous compliance record of the auditor or actuary.\n\n**Thresholds and Criteria**\n\nThe thresholds and criteria for determining the importance of these matters include:\n\n* The nature and seriousness of any contravention of FSMR or Rules, and the effect of that contravention.\n* Whether any contravention has resulted in or is likely to result in loss to customers, damage to the reputation of the ADGM, or an increased risk that a firm may be used for the purposes of financial crime.\n* The action taken to remedy the contravention, and any disciplinary action taken (or to be taken) by a relevant professional body.\n* The previous compliance record of the auditor or actuary, and whether the relevant regulatory body or professional body has imposed any previous disciplinary sanctions that may be relevant.\n\nIt is essential for auditors and actuaries to be aware of these thresholds and criteria to ensure that they notify the Regulator of all relevant matters upon ceasing to act, and thereby fulfill their regulatory obligations."

The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk.

The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

This suggests that the Authorised Person should have robust systems and processes in place to monitor its liquidity risk profile, which may include metrics such as liquidity ratios, cash flow projections, and funding requirements.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\nIn addition to monitoring its liquidity risk profile, the Authorised Person should also consider the following key areas:\n\n* Business continuity and Client engagement planning in the event of both planned and unplanned system outages (Technology Governance and Controls, c)\n* Processes and procedures specifying management of personnel and decision-making by qualified staff (Technology Governance and Controls, d)\n* Procedures for the creation and management of services, interfaces, and channels provided by or to third parties (Technology Governance and Controls, e)\n\n**Best Practices:**\nWhen establishing the systems and controls required under Rule 3.3.38, the Authorised Person should observe best practices, such as incorporating secure authentication, biometrics, and the monitoring of customer behavior metrics into anti-fraud and anti-Financial Crime systems and controls (COBS Rule 17.5). This suggests that the Authorised Person should adopt a proactive and risk-based approach to monitoring its liquidity risk profile, taking into account the evolving nature of Financial Crime.\n\nBy following these requirements and best practices, the Authorised Person can ensure that it complies with the regulatory obligations related to monitoring its liquidity risk profile."

In exercising this power, the Regulator may consider various factors, including reputational factors (Rule 11.7.4(11)) and the possibility of non-compliance with applicable legislation, including the Rules (Rule 3.1.4(a)). Additionally, the Regulator may take into account the objectives outlined in Rules 8.8.2 and 8.8.3 when determining whether to impose public censure. Furthermore, the Regulator's decision must be guided by the principles of ensuring that the Person or Fund complies with applicable legislation and that the censure would not adversely affect the advancement of any of the Regulator's objectives (Section 109 of the FSMR).\n\nIn the context of publicly censuring an individual or entity, it is essential to consider the specific circumstances of the non-compliance, including any reputational factors that may be relevant (Rule 11.7.4(11)). The Regulator must also evaluate whether the Person or Fund has complied with the requirements outlined in the Rules, including those related to governance, reporting, and disclosure (Rules 10.1.3B(1)(i), 2.3.16, and 2.3.2(1)). Ultimately, the decision to publicly censure an individual or entity must be grounded in a thorough assessment of the facts and a consideration of the Regulator's objectives, as outlined in the FSMR and the Rules."

Such a movement in the market price and/or traded volume of a Listed Entity\u2019s Securities may indicate that the information is no longer confidential and/or that the Reporting Entity\u2019s initial decision on whether the information is Inside Information was, or is now, incorrect.\n",

            "Chapter \u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.",

As illustrated in paragraph 2.2, an authorised money remittance house does not need to apply for specific approvals from the FSRA to use Virtual Assets if it merely uses Virtual Assets as a medium of exchange to facilitate the remittance of fiat currencies on behalf of Clients across jurisdictions.  The Regulated Firm will, however, have to demonstrate that the use of the Virtual Asset, used in such ancillary manner, is fit for purpose, e.g., putting in place control requirements to address technology and security risks associated with the use of the Virtual Asset.  On the other hand, for example, if the Regulated Firm offers its Clients services to exchange Virtual Assets for fiat currencies, the Regulated Firm will need to apply to, and be authorised by, the FSRA to use Virtual Assets as part of its Regulated Activities.\n",

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the FSRA's expectations regarding the frequency and depth of technology system audits for Authorised Persons engaged in regulated activities related to virtual assets can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Frequency of audits**: The FSRA expects Authorised Persons to regularly monitor material Exposures to Operational Risk losses (Para. An Authorised Person must: (a) regularly monitor material Exposures to Operational Risk losses;), which implies that technology system audits should be conducted on a regular basis to identify and mitigate operational risk.\n\n2. **Depth of audits**: The FSRA requires Authorised Persons to have adequate technology-related procedures, including security measures, systems development methodologies, and system penetration testing (Para. Historically, Virtual Asset business failures have often arisen as a result of the lack of adequate technology-related procedures...). This implies that technology system audits should be comprehensive and thorough, covering all aspects of technology governance and controls.\n\n3. **Focus on risk assessment**: The FSRA emphasizes the importance of risk-based assessments, including operational risk assessments that are closely integrated into the risk management processes of Recognised Bodies (Para. An operational risk assessment system shall be closely integrated into the risk management processes of the Recognised Clearing House.). Technology system audits should therefore focus on identifying and assessing operational risks associated with virtual assets.\n\n4. **Reporting and notification**: Authorised Persons are required to ensure that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place at their Governing Body, senior management, and business line levels to support effective management of Operational Risk (Para. An Authorised Person must: (b) ensure that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place...), and to immediately notify the Regulator of any material Operational Risk event (Para. An Authorised Person must: (c) immediately notify the Regulator of any material Operational Risk event...). Technology system audits should therefore ensure that reporting and notification mechanisms are in place and functioning effectively.\n\n5. **Fit and proper test**: The FSRA emphasizes the importance of the fit and proper test for Authorised Persons and Recognised Bodies, which includes consideration of their Close Links (Para. Under the fit and proper test for Authorised Persons and the requirements for a Financial Services Permission to be granted to Recognised Bodies...). Technology system audits should therefore assess the Authorised Person's ability to satisfy the Regulator with respect to their Close Links.\n\nIn summary, the FSRA expects technology system audits for Authorised Persons engaged in regulated activities related to virtual assets to be conducted regularly, with a comprehensive scope, and a focus on operational risk assessment, reporting, and notification.

This is explicitly stated in the context: \"A Credit Rating Agency must ensure that its Employees are not remunerated, or their performance evaluated, based on the amount of revenue generated or expected from the Credit Ratings in which the Employee was involved.\"\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThis requirement is essential to maintain the integrity of the credit rating process and prevent conflicts of interest. By not linking remuneration to revenue generated, the Credit Rating Agency can ensure that its employees make objective and unbiased credit rating decisions, free from any influence by revenue considerations.\n\n**Alignment with Regulatory Principles**\n\nThis requirement aligns with the regulatory principles outlined in the context, including:\n\n* The effectiveness of the regulatory regime depends on the maintenance of an open and co-operative relationship between the regulator and those regulated.\n* The regulator adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing on activities that pose the greatest risk to the furtherance of its objectives.\n* The regulator acts fairly, openly, accountably, and proportionately in the exercise of its enforcement powers.\n\n**Additional Requirements**\n\nIn addition to the remuneration requirement, Credit Rating Agencies must also ensure that their employees involved in credit ratings have reporting lines and remuneration arrangements designed to eliminate or effectively manage actual and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Credit Rating Agency must also differentiate ratings of structured finance products from traditional corporate bond ratings, clearly define rating symbols, and apply them consistently across all types of securities. Furthermore, the Agency must assess whether existing methodologies and models for determining credit ratings of structured finance products are appropriate when the risk characteristics of the assets underlying a structured finance product change materially.\n\nIn summary, a Credit Rating Agency cannot include revenue generated from credit ratings as a factor in the remuneration of its employees involved in those ratings, and must ensure that its employees are not remunerated or evaluated based on revenue generated or expected from credit ratings.

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question, covering all critical regulatory obligations and avoiding any contradictions:\n\nEntities engaged in spot commodity activities, such as Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs), Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), and Organised Trading Facilities (OTFs), are required to report details of orders and transactions in Accepted Spot Commodities traded on their platforms to the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA). Specifically, they must report on both a real-time and batch basis.\n\nIn terms of real-time reporting, entities must report transactions in Accepted Spot Commodities as soon as possible after the transaction has taken place. This is to ensure that the FSRA has timely and accurate information about market activity.\n\nIn addition to real-time reporting, entities must also submit batch reports to the FSRA. Batch reports should include detailed information about transactions in Accepted Spot Commodities, including the type of commodity, the parties involved, and the value of the transaction.\n\nEntities must also consider any additional reporting obligations that may apply to their spot commodity activities, including FATCA reporting obligations as set out in the Guidance Notes on the requirements of the Intergovernmental Agreement between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and Common Reporting Standards set out in the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017.\n\nFurthermore, entities must ensure that their reporting systems and controls are able to identify and prevent suspicious activity, including potential instances of financial crime. In this regard, entities must have in place effective systems and procedures for investigating and reporting suspicious activity, including the documentation of internal investigations and the making of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to the FSRA where necessary.\n\nEntities must also ensure that they have effective arrangements in place for the investigation and resolution of complaints arising in connection with their spot commodity activities, including the timely acknowledgement and investigation of complaints, and the provision of clear and timely responses to complainants.\n\nIn terms of record-keeping, entities must maintain accurate and complete records of their spot commodity activities, including records of transactions, orders, and investigations. These records must be available for inspection by the FSRA upon request.\n\nFinally, entities must ensure that their compliance advisers and auditors are aware of and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to spot commodity activities. This includes ensuring that auditors are able to confirm that entities have effective systems and controls in place to comply with regulatory requirements, and that they are able to identify and report any material discrepancies or weaknesses in these systems and controls."

According to Rule 12.14.1 of the Petroleum Exploration Reporting Entity's annual report, at least once every 12 months, the Summary of Reserves and Resources should be disclosed.\n2. Furthermore, as per the Audit Committee's terms of reference, the committee should review the effectiveness of the internal audit function (Auditing Standard 400, paragraph 23) and monitor the integrity of the financial statements (Auditing Standard 420, paragraph 17).\n3. The audit reports should include an assessment of the Operational Risk framework performed by control functions such as internal audit, compliance, risk management, and/or external audit (Section b of Operational Risks).\n\nB. External Audit Reports:\n\n1. As per the ADGM's guidance on the appointment and engagement of external auditors, the audit committee should review and monitor the external auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process (Auditing Standard 210, paragraph 22).\n2. The external audit reports should include an external opinion on the financial statements and a review of the internal controls and risk management systems (Auditing Standard 700, paragraph 14).\n3. Additionally, the external audit reports should disclose any significant findings and material breaches of the risk appetite and tolerance with respect to Operational Risk (Section d of Operational Risks).\n\nC. ESG Disclosures:\n\n1. As per the ADGM's guidance on ESG, ESG disclosures should be included in the annual report and should provide information about the Reporting Entity's ESG policies, practices, and performance (Section 3.3 of the ADGM's ESG Guidelines).\n2. The ESG disclosures should also include an assessment of the Reporting Entity's ESG risks and opportunities and its preparedness for ESG-related events (Section 3.4 of the ADGM's ESG Guidelines).\n\nD. Compliance:\n\n1. As per the ADGM's guidance on compliance, the compliance function should review and monitor the Reporting Entity's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and regulatory requirements (Section 4.2 of the ADGM's Compliance Guidelines).\n2. The compliance reports should include an assessment of the Reporting Entity's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and regulatory requirements and any significant findings or material breaches (Section 4.3 of the ADGM's Compliance Guidelines).\n\nIn conclusion, ADGM provides examples of internal and external audit reports for disclosure, particularly in relation to ESG disclosures and compliance. The internal audit reports should include an assessment of the Operational Risk framework, and the external audit reports should include an external opinion on the financial statements and a review of the internal controls and risk management systems. The ESG disclosures should include information about the Reporting Entity's ESG policies, practices, and performance, as well as an assessment of ESG risks and opportunities. The compliance reports should include an assessment of the Reporting Entity's compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and regulatory requirements."

In the case of Authorised Persons facing financial risks, the requirements in this Chapter mandate completion of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process.

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues. The implication therefore is that where an MTF or RIE, for example, controls access to a distributed ledger there may be a limit/restriction on an investor to transfer Digital Securities to another investor.

We must also conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and patch them promptly.\n\nSecondly, we must have a robust data protection policy that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client data. This includes implementing robust procedures for data collection, processing, and storage, and ensuring that all data handling activities are logged and auditable. We must also have protocols in place for data breaches and incidents, including notification to regulators and affected parties.\n\nThirdly, we must comply with all relevant data protection regulations, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This includes obtaining data subject consent, ensuring data minimization and pseudonymization, and providing data access and portability rights to clients.\n\nFourthly, we must ensure that our organization has a robust business continuity plan in place to ensure the continuity of business operations in the event of a disruption. This includes developing procedures for identifying and managing risks, developing incident response plans, and conducting regular testing and review of the plan.\n\nLastly, we must have a clear audit log of decision making, and staff with decision-making responsibilities must have the adequate expertise, particularly from a technological standpoint, to make such decisions.\n\nWe recognize that compliance with these regulatory requirements is critical to ensuring the safety and security of investor data and assets.

        "Answer": "The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) strives to strike a balance between fostering innovation in financial services and ensuring robust Anti-Money Laundering/anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/TFS) controls. As articulated in the regulatory framework, the ADGM recognizes the importance of a responsive and progressive regulatory environment that encourages innovation, while also ensuring that relevant persons comply with AML/TFS requirements.\n\nTo achieve this balance, the ADGM encourages innovative financial solutions, including those offered by FinTech start-ups, while also ensuring that these solutions are subject to robust AML/TFS controls. To remain compliant, relevant persons are required to satisfy all regulatory requirements, including those related to AML/TFS, prior to being granted a Financial Services Permission.\n\nIn particular, the ADGM has established a comprehensive regulatory framework that outlines the requirements for AML/TFS compliance, including the need for digital investment managers to put in place robust data security policies and systems to ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations. Additionally, the ADGM requires that fund managers take reasonable steps to ensure that they manage conflicts and follow good corporate governance practices, particularly in situations where they have placed persons on the board of undertakings in which they are investing.\n\nThe ADGM also emphasizes the importance of tailored and proportionate regulation, which takes into account the materiality of the risks posed by innovative financial solutions. This approach enables the ADGM to support the development and testing of new financial technologies in a cost-efficient environment, while also ensuring that the regulatory framework is responsive to emerging risks and challenges.\n\nTo ensure compliance with AML/TFS requirements while innovating, relevant persons should prioritize the following key steps:\n\n1. Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify potential AML/TFS risks associated with their innovative financial solutions.\n2. Implement robust AML/TFS policies, procedures, and controls to mitigate identified risks.\n3. Ensure that all staff and relevant persons are trained and competent in AML/TFS regulations and controls.\n4. Conduct regular monitoring and review of AML/TFS controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness and compliance.\n5. Demonstrate transparency and cooperation with regulatory authorities, including the ADGM's Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA).\n\nBy prioritizing AML/TFS compliance and implementing robust risk management strategies, relevant persons can successfully navigate the ADGM's regulatory framework while innovating in the financial services sector."

This requires a deep understanding of the customer's business and risk rating to determine if the transactions are consistent with the customer's profile.\n\nFurthermore, the compliance officer should \"enquire into the background and purpose of the Transactions in (b)\" as per Rule 8.3.1(1)(c) to gain a better understanding of the transactions and mitigate any potential risks.\n\nIn cases where there is still uncertainty or ambiguity, the compliance officer should \"periodically review the adequacy of the CDD information it holds on customers and Beneficial Owners to ensure that the information is kept up to date, particularly for customers with a high-risk rating\" as per Rule 8.3.1(1)(d).

            "The risk-based assessment of the customer and the proposed business relationship, Transaction or product required under this Chapter is required to be undertaken prior to the establishment of a business relationship with a customer. Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken.",

Relevant Persons must comply with these obligations to ensure transparency and accuracy in their reporting.\n\nAccording to Rule 7.2.1, Relevant Persons must disclose information in a timely and accurate manner, which aligns with the periodic/financial disclosure obligations set out in Chapter 10 of the Rules. This obligation is further emphasized by the requirement for Relevant Persons to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions, as set out in Chapter 11 of the AML Rulebook.\n\nIn addition, Relevant Persons must ensure that they comply with the general disclosure obligations under the Financial Services and Markets Regulations (FSMR), ADGM Commercial Laws, and international commercial and corporate laws. This includes disclosing material information to the market and making prospectus offers documents, bidders and targets statements, and other relevant disclosures.\n\nRegarding sanctions compliance, Relevant Persons must establish and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with applicable sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions. This includes reporting suspicious activity to the MLRO, who must investigate and document the circumstances, determine whether a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) or Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) must be made, and document such determination.\n\nThe MLRO must also make a SAR/STR as soon as practicable if required. Relevant Persons must inform the Regulator in writing if another jurisdiction's laws or regulations prevent or inhibit them from complying with the Federal AML Legislation or these Rules.\n\nThe ADGM also requires Relevant Persons to have information systems and analytical techniques that provide sufficient information on the risk profile and structure of the credit portfolio, including the following characteristics:\n\n* Size of Exposure\n* Exposure to Groups of related borrowers\n* Products\n* Sectors (e.g. geographic, industrial)\n* Borrowers' demographic profile for consumer credits\n* Account performance\n* Internal credit ratings\n* Outstandings versus commitments\n* Types and coverage of Collateral\n\nThe customer risk assessment must be completed:\n\n* Prior to establishing a business relationship with a customer\n* On a periodic basis, in accordance with Rule 8.6.1(e)\n* Whenever it is otherwise appropriate for existing customers, including where the Relevant Person becomes aware of any change to the risk factors associated with the customer that might contribute to the potential for money laundering risk to increase materially.\n\nThe regulatory requirements applicable to all Persons to whom the FSMR applies would initially apply to each applicant for an FSP to carry on the Regulated Activity of Developing Financial Technology Services within the RegLab.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADGM has established a robust framework for overseeing and enforcing compliance with rules and regulations, including continuous disclosure obligations, periodic/financial disclosure obligations, and general disclosure obligations.

Additionally, Schedule 2 of the FSMR specifies the limited circumstances in which a person may market Units in a way that does not breach the general prohibition.\n\nTherefore, the ADGM should provide guidance on the minimum standards or best practices for employee whistleblower protections, ensuring that disclosures related to market abuse or financial crime can be made safely and confidentially.

This can be achieved by implementing robust whistleblower procedures that provide a secure and confidential channel for employees to report any suspicions of market abuse or financial crime.\n\n(b) The ADGM should ensure that its rules and procedures enable the detection of possible instances of market abuse or financial crime. This can be achieved by implementing surveillance and monitoring systems that can detect suspicious patterns of trading or other activities that may indicate market abuse or financial crime.\n\n(c) The ADGM should ensure that its rules and procedures enable the communication of information about market abuse or financial crime to appropriate organizations. This can be achieved by implementing a reporting system that allows for the prompt and accurate communication of any suspicious activity or wrongdoing to the relevant authorities.\n\n(d) The ADGM should ensure that its rules and procedures enable cooperation with all relevant bodies in the prevention, investigation, and pursuit of market abuse or financial crime. This can be achieved by providing adequate resources and support to enable coordination and cooperation with other regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn addition to the above, the ADGM should also consider the reporting requirements outlined in Section 18 of the FSMR, which requires Authorised Persons to report any breaches of the general prohibition to the Regulator. The ADGM should also consider the requirements outlined in the Rules, which prescribe the content and manner of giving notice of any breach to the Regulator.\n\nIn conclusion, the ADGM should provide guidance on the minimum standards or best practices for employee whistleblower protections, ensuring that disclosures related to market abuse or financial crime can be made safely and confidentially.

This approach ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively to minimize potential financial and reputational losses.\n\nFurthermore, the ADGM emphasizes the importance of embedding the risk-based approach within the organization's compliance culture, allowing for informed decision-making and resource allocation. This requires senior management to cascade the RBA down to all levels of the organization, ensuring that everyone understands their role in AML/TFS compliance.\n\nBy adopting this risk-based approach, financial institutions can ensure that their AML/TFS resources are allocated effectively, and that they are better equipped to mitigate the risks associated with NFTF business and eKYC."

The proportion of Inferred Mineral Resources and an Exploration Target that may be added to the end of the mine plan depends on the maturity of a Mining Project.

Specifically:\n\n* When Ore Reserves or Proved Ore Reserves have been partially depleted, a Mining Reporting Entity may have reasonable grounds to disclose a Production Target, given the level of geological knowledge and confidence involved.\n* However, if Indicated Mineral Resources or Measured Mineral Resources have been partially depleted, a Mining Reporting Entity should have given sufficient consideration to the modifying factors to have reasonable grounds for disclosure, and clearly disclose the material assumptions made in this regard.\n* In cases where a Mining Reporting Entity has disclosed estimates of Ore Reserves, Indicated Mineral Resources, or Measured Mineral Resources, it may have reasonable grounds to include some level of Inferred Mineral Resources or an Exploration Target in a Production Target, subject to confirming that the respective proportions of Inferred Mineral Resources or Exploration Target do not feature as a significant proportion in the early mine plan, as defined in Rule 11.8.3(4), which means 25% or less of the Mineralisation used to determine the Production Target is attributed to Inferred Mineral Resources and/or an Exploration Target.\n* A Mining Reporting Entity may only have reasonable grounds to base a Production Target wholly on Inferred Mineral Resources if it complies with Rule 11.8.3(5).\n* In cases where a Production Target is disclosed, but there has been a partial depletion of the Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves, the Mining Reporting Entity should disclose the material changes in estimates and the impact on the Production Target.\n\nIn conclusion, a Mining Reporting Entity should carefully consider the facts and circumstances of each case, the level of geological knowledge and confidence involved, and the requirements of the FSMR when approaching the disclosure of a Production Target when there has been a partial depletion of the Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves since the initial disclosure under Rule 11.8.3."

This means that the training should be tailored to the specific business and risk profile of the entity, and should be conducted regularly to ensure that employees are aware of and can identify and report suspicious transactions.\n\nThe training program should also cover the internal risk assessment process (IRAP), which is a comprehensive internal risk evaluation that is detailed in Section 10.3 and further elaborated in App11. The IRAP should be carried out by Authorised Persons, including those conducting Regulated Activities in relation to Virtual Assets, and should take into account reporting obligations under FATCA and the Common Reporting Standards.\n\nIn addition to the IRAP, the training program should also cover the disclosure requirements under Rule 11.2.1, which applies to all disclosures made or required to be made under the Rules, including statements about Exploration Targets, Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves, and Production Targets. Issuers and Mining Reporting Entities should be mindful of the table format for disclosure of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources set out in MKT Form-11-1.\n\nFurthermore, the training program should cover the operational risk management requirements, which include regular monitoring of material exposures to operational risk losses, ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place, and immediately notifying the Regulator of any material operational risk event.\n\nThe training program should also be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it remains effective and relevant. The frequency of review and update will depend on the results of the IRAP and the risk profile of the entity, but it should be at least annually, as required by the regulations.\n\nIn summary, an adequate money laundering training program and awareness arrangements for ADGM compliance should include:\n\n1. A Risk-Based Approach (RBA) that is proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant employees.\n2. A comprehensive internal risk assessment process (IRAP) that is detailed in Section 10.3 and further elaborated in App11.\n3. Disclosure requirements under Rule 11.2.1 that apply to all disclosures made or required to be made under the Rules.\n4. Operational risk management requirements, including regular monitoring of material exposures to operational risk losses, ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place, and immediately notifying the Regulator of any material operational risk event.\n5. Regular review and update of the training program to ensure that it remains effective and relevant."

The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

This may involve providing documentation or other evidence of compliance, such as a revised Fund Prospectus or updated Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) measures.\n\nKey regulatory requirements and procedures mentioned in the context include the following:\n\n* Conducting a risk assessment under Rule 6.2.1(c) to identify actions to mitigate risks associated with undertaking Non-Financial Transactional Fund Businesses (NFTF) generally, and the use of electronic Know-Your-Customer (eKYC) specifically.\n* Implementing risk mitigation measures recommended by the Regulator, a competent authority of the U.A.E., FATF, and other relevant bodies.\n* Assessing the potential for risks associated with all applicable aspects of Financial Crime prior to launching any new product, service, or business practice.\n* Undertaking CDD in a manner proportionate to the customer's money laundering risks, including Enhanced Customer Due Diligence measures for high-risk customers.\n* Maintaining systems and controls to identify and monitor the effect on the Insurer of its relationship with other members of the Group and the activities of other members of its Group, including procedures to monitor changes in relationships between Group members, changes in the activities of Group members, conflicts of interest arising within the Group, and events in the Group.\n\nThe FSRA may refuse to grant an application for DNFBP registration where it is not satisfied that the applicant meets the criteria for registration under Rule 15.2. Additionally, the Regulator may determine not to publish information under this section if, in its opinion, publication would be unfair to the person with respect to whom the action was taken, prejudicial to the interests of customers, or detrimental to the stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial System."

The FSRA\u2019s Spot Commodities Framework, therefore, intends to ensure that participants can operate in markets that have suitable minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply, including adherence to internationally recognised certification standards.  Consumers, participants and investors benefit by the introduction of greater transparency, resilience and integrity into commodity markets.\n"

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, particularly the FSRA's Spot Commodities Framework and the Sustainable Finance Agenda, I can provide a detailed explanation of the minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply that your company must meet to comply with the FSRA's Spot Commodities Framework.\n\nTo start, the FSRA's Spot Commodities Framework aims to establish minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply in commodity markets. This includes adherence to internationally recognized certification standards, which ensures transparency, resilience, and integrity in these markets. Consistent with this goal, your company must demonstrate that it can meet these minimum standards.\n\nFirstly, your company must apply internationally recognized certification standards, such as ISO 14001 for Environmental Management and ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety, to ensure that its operations and supply chain are sustainable and responsible. This may involve implementing internal policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these standards and regularly monitoring and reviewing its performance to identify areas for improvement.\n\nSecondly, your company must maintain transparency in its sourcing and supply chain, including the origin of commodities, to allow for effective tracking and tracing of goods. This may involve keeping accurate records of sourcing and supply chain transactions, as well as providing information to customers and stakeholders upon request.\n\nThirdly, your company must ensure that its supply chain is free from child labor, forced labor, and other forms of exploitation. This may involve assessing its supply chain to identify potential risks and implementing measures to mitigate these risks, such as conducting regular audits and working with suppliers to promote ethical labor practices.\n\nFourthly, your company must minimize its environmental impact, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving water and energy resources, and promoting sustainable practices throughout its operations and supply chain. This may involve implementing sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and promoting recycling.\n\nLastly, your company must continuously monitor and assess its performance against these minimum standards, including identifying areas for improvement and implementing measures to address these areas. This may involve conducting regular audits and assessments, as well as seeking feedback from stakeholders and implementing corrective actions as necessary.\n\nIn summary, the FSRA's Spot Commodities Framework requires companies to meet minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply, including adherence to internationally recognized certification standards, maintaining transparency in sourcing and supply chain, ensuring a supply chain free from exploitation, minimizing environmental impact, and continuously monitoring and assessing performance."

As per Rule A4.10.1, if the RWA amounts of the mezzanine securitisation positions held by the Originator do not exceed 50% of the RWA amounts of all mezzanine securitisation positions existing in the securitisation, it is considered that significant credit risk has been transferred, and the Originator is required to hold a lower level of regulatory capital (Source: Rules A4.10.1 and A4.10.2).\n\nAdditionally, the Authorised Person may apply a risk weight of 100% or the highest risk weight assigned to any of the underlying exposures in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programme, whichever is higher, to an unrated securitisation exposure arising from the ABCP programme, provided the securitisation position meets certain conditions (Source: Rules A4.10.1 and A4.10.2).\n\nIn determining the regulatory capital requirements for Operational Risk, the Authorised Person should consider the adoption of a risk-based approach, which takes into account the probability and potential impact of operational failures, as well as the institution's risk appetite and risk tolerance (Source: ADGM Regulations).\n\nFurthermore, the Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must maintain systems and controls that include suitable, documented policies and procedures designed to ensure effective risk management, including credit risk and concentration risk, and the timely, appropriate, and accurate valuation of Fund Property (Source: Rule 13A.7).\n\nThe FSRA also expects Authorised Persons to consider any reporting obligations, including FATCA and Common Reporting Standards, as set out in the Guidance Notes on the requirements of the Intergovernmental Agreement between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017 (Source: FATCA and Common Reporting Standards).\n\nIn summary, the ADGM determines the appropriate level of regulatory capital for Authorised Persons by considering the risk-weighted assets of securitisation positions, the application of risk weights to unrated securitisation exposures, and the adoption of a risk-based approach to operational risk, in addition to considering reporting obligations and maintaining effective risk management systems and controls."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nTo clarify the specific requirements for Direct Electronic Access (DEA), including the minimum standards for Members' controls and the audit trail completeness for transactions processed through electronic connection systems, we need to analyze the relevant regulatory obligations.\n\nFirstly, the arrangements for DEA should include rules and guidance governing Members' procedures, controls, and security arrangements for inputting instructions into the system (point a). This ensures that Members have robust processes and procedures in place to prevent and resolve problems likely to arise from the use of electronic systems.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangements should also include rules and guidance governing the facilities provided by Members to their Clients to input instructions into the system, as well as restrictions on the use of those systems (point b). This ensures that Clients' instructions are verified and validated before being processed through the electronic connection system.\n\nFurthermore, the arrangements should provide rules and practices to detect, identify, and halt or remove instructions breaching any relevant restrictions (point c). This ensures that any suspicious or unauthorized transactions are detected and prevented from reaching their intended destination.\n\nRegarding the audit trail completeness, the arrangements should provide for the quality and completeness of the audit trail of any transaction processed through an electronic connection system (point d). This ensures that a detailed and comprehensive record of all transactions is maintained, allowing for effective tracking, monitoring, and auditing of transactions.\n\nFinally, the arrangements should also include procedures to determine whether to suspend trading by those systems or access to them by or through individual Members (point e). This ensures that the system can be quickly shut down or access restricted in the event of a security breach or other problem.\n\nIn addition to the above requirements, it is also essential to conduct a business risk assessment under Rule 6.1.1(b) to identify the risks associated with the carrying on of NFTF business, particularly the use of eKYC Systems. This assessment should consider incorporating any relevant mitigation measures identified by the Regulator, a competent authority, FATF, and other relevant bodies.\n\nTherefore, in summary, the specific requirements for DEA include:\n\n* Robust processes and procedures for inputting instructions into the system\n* Verification and validation of Clients' instructions\n* Detection, identification, and prevention of suspicious or unauthorized transactions\n* Quality and completeness of the audit trail of transactions\n* Procedures for suspending trading or access to systems\n* Business risk assessment to identify and mitigate risks associated with NFTF business and eKYC Systems"

This system should be closely integrated with the risk management processes of the Relevant Person and should provide clear and concise information to Employees on their roles and responsibilities in managing operational risks.\n\nIn addition, the Relevant Person should have procedures in place for the creation and management of services, interfaces, and channels provided by or to third parties, as well as processes and procedures specifying management of personnel and decision-making by qualified staff. The Relevant Person should also have procedures for the management of data and the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions.\n\nOverall, a well-designed and well-implemented money laundering training program and awareness arrangements are critical to ensuring compliance with Chapter 13 and minimizing the risk of money laundering."
