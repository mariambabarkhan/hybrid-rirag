        "Answer": "When applying Rule 12.2.3, a Petroleum Reporting Entity should distinguish between 'Prospective Resources' and 'Contingent Resources' for disclosure purposes by considering the following key differences:\n\n* Prospective Resources refer to the estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be discovered in a given area, which have not been tested by drilling or other exploration methods (implied from the context of Rules 12.8, 12.10, and 12.12).\n* Contingent Resources, on the other hand, represent the estimated quantities of petroleum that are potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but are not yet considered Petroleum Reserves due to uncertainty regarding commercial viability, regulatory approvals, or other constraints (implied from the context of Rules 12.8, 12.10, and 12.12).\n* To determine whether a material change in estimates has occurred, the Petroleum Reporting Entity should test the current estimates of Prospective Resources, Contingent Resources, or Petroleum Reserves against the last disclosed estimates, which may have been either the initial estimates or subsequent disclosures of materially changed estimates (as stated in the context of \"What is a material change in estimates?\").\n* When making disclosures, the Petroleum Reporting Entity should include the required information specified in Rules 12.8, 12.10, and 12.12, where a material change (up or down) in estimates of Prospective Resources, Contingent Resources, or Petroleum Reserves has occurred compared to the last disclosed estimates (as stated in Rules 12.8, 12.10, and 12.12).\n\nNote that the question does not ask about the reporting obligations in relation to Virtual Assets, FATCA, or Common Reporting Standards, which are mentioned in the context as part of a separate regulatory requirement. Therefore, this answer focuses exclusively on the application of Rule 12.2.3 and the distinction between Prospective Resources and Contingent Resources for disclosure purposes."

        ],
        "Answer": "Based on the ADGM's regulatory requirements, here are the expectations for employee training and awareness programs regarding the protection of sensitive data related to virtual assets:\n\nRegarding the protection of sensitive customer data, organisations are required to comply with the ADGM Data Protection Regime and apply best-practice safeguards for the security and protection of sensitive customer data during transit, processing, and storage. This implies that employee training and awareness programs should focus on educating employees on the importance of data protection, confidentiality, and security to prevent any compromise.\n\nIn addition, when it comes to anti-money laundering (AML) and combatting the financing of terrorism (TFS) risks in relation to virtual assets, Authorised Persons should adopt a risk-based approach (RBA) to comply with Chapter 13 of the regulatory requirements. Specifically, they should provide AML/TFS training and awareness programs that are proportionate to the money laundering risks of the business and the role of the relevant Employees. This means that employee training and awareness programs should be tailored to the specific risks associated with virtual assets and the roles of employees involved in handling sensitive customer data related to these assets.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of an unplanned system outage, Authorised Persons should have clear, publicly available procedures in place to rapidly disseminate key information and updates on a frequent basis. Employee training and awareness programs should therefore include procedures for responding to unplanned outages, ensuring that employees are equipped to handle such situations effectively and maintain the security and confidentiality of sensitive customer data.\n\nOverall, the ADGM's expectations for employee training and awareness programs emphasize the importance of adopting a risk-based approach to protect sensitive customer data related to virtual assets, while also ensuring that employees are equipped to respond to unplanned system outages and maintain the confidentiality and security of customer data."

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that addresses the question:\n\nADGM enforces compliance with tax reporting regulations for non-traditional or emerging virtual assets that might not fit into existing categories by requiring Authorised Persons to consider and adhere to their tax reporting obligations under COBS Rule 17.4. This includes considering obligations under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d) and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017.\n\nTo achieve this, ADGM takes a substance-over-form approach, considering not only the immediate asset but also any underlying assets when assessing compliance with tax reporting obligations. This means that Authorised Persons must examine the underlying assets of the virtual asset to determine whether they meet the relevant tax reporting requirements.\n\nFurthermore, ADGM may impose restrictions on Authorised Persons engaging in certain activities, such as margin trading, if they are not permitted or propose to carry out such activities. This ensures that only Authorised Persons that have the necessary permissions and compliance measures in place are able to engage in such activities.\n\nOverall, ADGM's enforcement approach is centered around ensuring that Authorised Persons understand and comply with their tax reporting obligations, regardless of whether the virtual assets in question fit into traditional categories or are emerging and non-traditional."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, here is a structured answer that addresses the question about risk mitigation strategies required by the FSRA to handle potential delivery disruptions or disputes over Accepted Spot Commodities:\n\nTo mitigate the risks of disruption to, or dispute over, the delivery of Accepted Spot Commodities, an Authorised Person must have arrangements in place, including with any delivery and/or storage facility it is using, to address the following risks:\n\n**Late Delivery or Loading**: The arrangements must include a plan for resolving delays in delivery, including alternative loadings, dates, or book-outs. Examples of acceptable resolution mechanisms for late delivery or loading include negotiating with the counterparty to agree on a new delivery date, exploring alternative delivery locations, or engaging a third-party logistics provider to facilitate delivery.\n\n**Force Majeure Events**: The arrangements must also include resolution mechanisms for force majeure events that may impact delivery. Examples of acceptable resolution mechanisms for force majeure events include invoking contractual clauses that provide for suspension or termination of delivery obligations, negotiating with counterparties to agree on a new delivery schedule, or engaging insurance coverage to mitigate the impact of force majeure events.\n\n**Dispute over Quality or Condition**: Furthermore, the arrangements must address disputes that may arise over the quality or condition of the Commodity, resulting from deviations in the Accepted Spot Commodity deliverable specifications. Examples of acceptable resolution mechanisms for disputes over quality or condition include engaging independent surveyors or inspectors to assess the Commodity, negotiating with counterparties to agree on a settlement or compensation, or referring the dispute to arbitration or mediation.\n\nIn addition to these mitigation strategies, Authorised Persons must ensure that their arrangements are aligned with the FSRA's commitment to sustainability, transparency, resilience, and integrity in commodity markets. This includes adhering to internationally recognised certification standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing and supply.\n\nOverall, an Authorised Person's arrangements must be designed to prevent or mitigate delivery disruptions or disputes over Accepted Spot Commodities, and must include resolution mechanisms that are fair, transparent, and consistent with the FSRA's regulatory requirements."

            "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nCryptographic Keys and wallet storage\nThe ability to send and receive Virtual Assets by recording new transactions on a distributed ledger is usually dependent on cryptographic keys \u2013 a public key and one or more private keys. The public key allows other users on a distributed ledger to send Virtual Assets to an address associated with that public key. The private key(s) provides full control of the Virtual Assets associated with the public key. As such, Authorised Persons need to have robust procedures and protective measures to ensure the secure offline generation, storage, backup and destruction of both public and private keys for their own wallet operations and where they offer wallet services to Clients.\n",

For RIEs or MTFs trading in Digital Securities, the FSRA\u2019s expectation is that paragraph 166d of the Virtual Assets Guidance (where an infrastructure is using its own fiat tokens as a payment/transaction mechanism solely within its own platform/ecosystem) is likely to be the only scenario for the use of stablecoins by a RIE or MTF trading in Digital Securities.

Specifically, this includes:\n\n1. **Offline generation**: Authorised Persons must ensure the secure offline generation of both public and private keys for their own wallet operations and where they offer wallet services to Clients.\n2. **Storage**: Authorised Persons must have robust procedures for the secure storage of public and private keys, including the use of protective measures to prevent unauthorised access or theft.\n3. **Backup**: Authorised Persons must have a secure backup process in place for public and private keys to prevent loss or compromise of keys.\n4. **Destruction**: Authorised Persons must have a secure process for destroying private keys when they are no longer required, to prevent unauthorised access or use.\n\nIn terms of key management, Authorised Persons must ensure that private keys are kept confidential and secure, and that access to private keys is restricted to authorised personnel only. Furthermore, Authorised Persons must implement appropriate measures to prevent the loss, theft, or misuse of private keys, such as through the use of secure encryption, access controls, and auditing.\n\nIt is also important to note that the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those related to stablecoins, as outlined in paragraphs 162-166 of the Virtual Assets Guidance.

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question, covering all critical regulatory obligations and avoiding any contradictions:\n\nWhen offering co-investment opportunities in high-risk ventures through a Venture Capital Fund, specific consumer protection measures and investor qualifications must be adhered to. Firstly, the Fund Manager must obtain a Financial Services Permission to Manage a Collective Investment Fund, which is a Venture Capital Fund, or have a Financial Services Permission restricted to the management of Venture Capital Funds. Additionally, the Fund Manager may need to conduct the Regulated Activities of Advising on Deals in Investments and Arranging Deals in Investments, for which no additional application or supervision fees will be incurred if these activities are restricted to co-investments in assets in which the Venture Capital Fund is invested.\n\nIn terms of disclosure requirements, a Prospectus must be prepared, and the disclosure requirements for a Public Fund are more extensive than those for Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds. Therefore, the Fund Manager must ensure that the Prospectus includes all necessary information to enable investors to make informed investment decisions. Furthermore, where the Venture Capital Fund is an Exempt Fund or a Qualified Investor Fund, the offering document must comply with the relevant regulations and guidelines.\n\nIt is also essential to ensure that robust data security policies and systems are in place to protect client data and prevent cyberattacks, as Digital Investment Managers are heavily dependent on collecting and processing client data and operate largely digitally. Compliance with all relevant data protection regulations, including the ADGM's Data Protection Regulations and PRU 6.6-6.9, is mandatory.\n\nRegarding investor qualifications, the Venture Capital Fund may only be offered to qualified investors, such as institutional investors, high net worth individuals, or sophisticated investors who meet the eligibility criteria set out in the relevant regulations. The Fund Manager must ensure that each investor has the necessary knowledge, experience, and expertise to understand the risks associated with investing in high-risk ventures.\n\nIn summary, the key consumer protection measures and investor qualifications that must be adhered to when offering co-investment opportunities in high-risk ventures through a Venture Capital Fund include obtaining the necessary Financial Services Permission, complying with disclosure requirements, implementing robust data security policies and systems, and ensuring that only qualified investors are eligible to participate in the Fund."

This requirement would be triggered if the Regulator identifies potential deficiencies in the Authorised Person's risk assessment, policies, procedures, and controls related to new products and services. For instance, if an Authorised Person fails to recognize and control credit risk arising from new business transactions, or if their risk assessment is inadequate, a report from a Skilled Person may be necessary to address these concerns.\n\nUpon identification of such circumstances, the Regulator may give written notice to the Authorised Person, requiring a report to be provided by a Skilled Person. This notice would set out the purpose of the proposed report, the scope, the timetable for completion, and any other relevant matters (GEN 8.12(a)). The Authorised Person would then be required to appoint a Skilled Person, nominated and/or approved by the Regulator, to conduct the assessment and provide the report (GEN 8.12(b)).\n\nDuring the assessment, the Skilled Person would be expected to cooperate with the Regulator and receive all necessary assistance from the Authorised Person (GEN 8.12(c)). The Authorised Person would be responsible for paying for the services of the Skilled Person (GEN 8.12(d)). The report provided by the Skilled Person would aim to identify areas of improvement in the Authorised Person's operational risk management and provide recommendations for enhancing their risk controls.\n\nThroughout the process, the Regulator may exercise its powers to suspend any payment or delivery obligations pursuant to contracts involving the Authorised Person, if deemed necessary, under section \u200e24\u200e(3) of the ADGM rules (GEN 8.12(d)). However, this suspension would be limited to the specified duration, and any payment or delivery obligations would become due immediately upon expiry of the suspension period (GEN 8.12(d)(a)). Furthermore, the suspension of payment or delivery obligations would also affect the counterparty's obligations under the contract for the same period (GEN 8.12(d)(b)).\n\nUltimately, the requirement for a report from a Skilled Person would serve to ensure that Authorised Persons maintain robust operational risk management practices, particularly in relation to credit risk control, and that they have adequate policies, procedures, and controls in place to mitigate potential risks associated with new products and services."

This built upon previous FATF statements by clarifying a RBA for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (\u201cAML/CFT\u201d) purposes.

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer to the question:\n\nIn the case of custody of fiat currency linked to third-party fiat tokens, the FSRA provides specific requirements and preferences for selecting a Virtual Asset/Fiat Custodian. Firstly, the Authorised Person must directly meet the requirements of the Accepted Virtual Assets, Technology Governance, and AML/CFT sections of the Guidance when using third-party fiat tokens (i). \n\nIn terms of fiat currency custody activities, the FSRA prefers that the MTF utilises a Virtual Asset/Fiat Custodian authorised on the basis of paragraphs 139-145 or 166(b) of the Guidance (ii). \n\nWhen it comes to the issuance of the related fiat token, if the issuer is not authorised under paragraph 166(a), the Authorised Person is expected to undertake the same due diligence as that applied for determining Accepted Virtual Assets (iii). This due diligence should focus on Technology Governance requirements, the seven factors used to determine an Accepted Virtual Asset, and requirements relating to reporting and reconciliation. \n\nMoreover, as part of the AML/CFT obligations, the Authorised Person must identify, assess, and take effective action to mitigate ML/TF risks, in accordance with the FATF Guidelines and the FSRA's Risk-Based Approach (RBA) for Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\nIn addition, to benefit from the exemption provided for in sections 93(3) and 97(1) of the FSMR and CMC 8(4), Price Stabilisation of a Relevant Security must be carried out in accordance with Rules 6.2.8, 6.2.9, and 6.2.10.\n\nTherefore, the FSRA's requirements and preferences for selecting a Virtual Asset/Fiat Custodian involve meeting the necessary regulatory obligations, undertaking due diligence, and adhering to AML/CFT and Technology Governance requirements."

Dirham on behalf of a Client.\" This sentence clearly prohibits Authorised Persons engaged in the Regulated Activity of Accepting Deposits from undertaking foreign exchange transactions involving the U.A.E.

This includes the provision of regular management information to the Senior Management on the operation and effectiveness of AML/TFS systems and controls, enabling the identification, measurement, management, and control of money laundering risks (b)(i).\n\n**Board Responsibility and Operational Risk Management**\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that the Relevant Person's systems and controls comply with the GEN rules and Federal AML Legislation (b)(iii). This involves the Board overseeing the implementation of effective policies, procedures, and systems to identify, assess, monitor, and manage money laundering risks adequately (c). Regular risk assessments are required to ensure the adequacy of the AML/TFS systems and controls, which must be comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale, and complexity of the Relevant Person's activities (c).\n\n**Integration with Operational Risk Management Framework**\n\nThe GEN rules' Corporate Governance requirements for Board responsibilities integrate with the Operational Risk management framework by requiring the Board to oversee the implementation of effective policies, procedures, and systems to manage money laundering risks. This includes regularly reviewing and assessing the adequacy of the AML/TFS systems and controls to ensure they continue to enable the Relevant Person to identify, assess, monitor, and manage money laundering risks adequately.\n\n**Additional Requirements for Mining and Petroleum Reporting Entities**\n\nFor Mining Reporting Entities, the GEN rules require full compliance with all binding requirements set out in a Mining Reporting Standard, as well as non-mandatory requirements, including Table 1 of the JORC Code or SAMREC Code (Rule 11.2.1(1)). For Petroleum Reporting Entities, disclosures that include statements about Petroleum Resources must be prepared in accordance with the Petroleum Reporting Standard and Chapter 12 of the Rules (Rule 12).\n\n**Compliance and Reporting**\n\nThe GEN rules require the Relevant Person to ensure compliance with these Rules and Federal AML Legislation (b)(iii), as well as the Penal Code (b)(iv). The Relevant Person must also comply with the requirements for all disclosures, including explanation of non-compliance in accordance with Rule 11.2.2.\n\nIn conclusion, the GEN rules' Corporate Governance requirements for Board responsibilities integrate with the Operational Risk management framework by requiring the Board to oversee the implementation of effective policies, procedures, and systems to manage money laundering risks. This includes regularly reviewing and assessing the adequacy of the AML/TFS systems and controls, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and reporting in accordance with the Rules and relevant Standards."

            "Chapter \u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.",
            "Similarly, in using a new or developing technology, such as those associated with the Regulated Activity of Developing Financial Technology Services within the RegLab or when undertaking NFTF business, a Relevant Person should pay specific attention to assessing the potential for risks associated with Financial Crime that might arise as a result of implementing that innovative technology. For example, while the use of eKYC Systems may reduce the risk of impersonation fraud at customer onboarding, NFTF interaction with the customer may increase the risk of Financial Crime after a business relationship has been established, through transaction fraud, money laundering or theft of digitally stored CDD documentation."

This includes instances where the ADGM issues a written notice to a firm or Recognised Body, requiring a report to be provided by a Skilled Person, setting out the purpose of the proposed report, the scope, the timetable for completion, and any other relevant matters (GEN 8.12 (a)). The Skilled Person is appointed by the firm or Recognised Body, and the ADGM has the election to nominate and/or approve the appointment (GEN 8.12 (b)). The Skilled Person is required to co-operate with the ADGM and is provided with all assistance by the firm or Recognised Body that the Skilled Person may reasonably require (GEN 8.12 (c)). Furthermore, the firm or Recognised Body is responsible for paying for the services of the Skilled Person (GEN 8.12 (d)). Additionally, the ADGM may require a Skilled Person's report to verify the Exposure Measure, which is calculated in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), subject to adjustments such as netting on-balance sheet, non-Derivative Exposures of specific allowances and valuation adjustments, physical or financial Collateral, guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques not being used to reduce exposure values of assets, and loans not being netted with Deposits. Moreover, the ADGM may require a Skilled Person's report to assess the management of personnel and decision-making processes, including the maintenance of a clear audit log of decision making and ensuring that staff with decision-making responsibilities have adequate expertise, particularly from a technological standpoint, to make informed decisions.\n\nEach sentence in this response aligns with the corresponding sentence in the source passage(s), covering all critical regulatory obligations and avoiding any contradictions."

        "Answer": "The main goal of the Credit Risk management system for an Authorised Person in terms of capital requirements is to ensure that the institution's capital base is sufficient to cover potential losses arising from various credit exposures, thereby maintaining its financial stability and soundness. \n\nThis goal is achieved by implementing a comprehensive Credit Risk policy that includes a range of factors, such as approved risk tolerance, capital allocated to Credit Risk, business strategy, and market conditions in its main credit markets (a). The policy must provide sound credit norms and criteria for approval of credit applications, specifying exposure limits, product types, business segments, nature of target borrowers, and the nature of Credit Risk (b, c). \n\nThe policy should also set out the amounts and terms and conditions under which counterparties or clients may be eligible or ineligible for credit, including minimum information required to process an application for credit (d, e). Furthermore, the policy must include well-defined criteria and policies for approving new exposures, renewing and refinancing existing exposures, and identifying the appropriate approval authority for the size and complexity of the exposures (f). \n\nEffective credit administration policies, including continued analysis of a borrower's ability and willingness to repay, monitoring of documentation, legal covenants, contractual requirements, and collateral, are also essential components of the Credit Risk management system (g). The system should include comprehensive policies for reporting exposures on an ongoing basis, identifying and managing problem assets, and provisioning for loan losses (h, i, j). \n\nAdditionally, the policy must set out limits and approval processes involved for the approval of credit facilities, with the Governing Body retaining responsibility for governance (k). Major credit risk exposures exceeding a specified amount or all large exposures must be approved by the Authorised Person's senior management or its designated body, such as a credit committee (l). Similarly, all credit risk exposures that are especially risky or inconsistent with the approved credit strategy must be approved by the Authorised Person's senior management or its designated body (m).\n\nIn terms of risk management systems, the Authorised Person's system must be appropriate to the size, mix of business, and complexity of its operations, integrating risk management with the conduct of its business and operations (a). The system must address all material risks, both existing and potential, financial and non-financial, to which the Authorised Person is exposed or likely to be exposed (c). \n\nThe relationships between the Authorised Person's risk tolerance limits, capital requirements, economic capital, and the processes and methods for assuming, pricing, and monitoring risk must be described (d). Finally, the system must be supported by adequate risk management policies and procedures explaining the risks covered, measurement approaches used, and key assumptions made (e)."

        "Answer": "The question inquires about the timeframe within which an insurer is expected to provide a client with all entitled documentation and information upon request, specifically after the insurance policy expires. According to the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific timeframe for providing documentation and information to clients after policy expiration. \n\nHowever, in the context of the regulatory obligations mentioned in the passage, it is essential to note the following:\n\n* An Insurer or Insurance Intermediary must explain to a Client their duty to disclose all circumstances material to the insurance and the consequences of any failure to make such disclosures (Rule \u200e7.8.4).\n* A Reporting Entity must disclose changes to its accounting reference date as soon as possible, and if necessary, provide a second interim report within six months of the old accounting reference date (Rule 7.7.1).\n\nWhile there is no specific timeframe mentioned for providing documentation and information to clients after policy expiration, insurers and insurance intermediaries are required to maintain accurate records and provide timely disclosures to their clients. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that insurers should provide clients with their entitled documentation and information in a timely manner upon request, ideally within a reasonable timeframe considering the nature and complexity of the requested information.\n\nIn conclusion, although the exact timeframe is not specified, insurers are expected to provide clients with all entitled documentation and information upon request in a timely and efficient manner, aligning with their broader regulatory obligations."

To clarify, the FSRA will require that arrangements to use a DSF for settlement purposes will require the DSF to comply with the requirements of MIR Rule 4.3.3 (with the references to a RCH being read as references to a DSF).\n",
            "DIGITAL SECURITIES SETTLEMENT\nDigital Settlement Facilities (DSFs)\nFor the purposes of this Guidance and distinct from RCHs, the FSRA will consider DSFs suitable for the purposes of settlement (MIR Rule 3.8) and custody (MIR Rule 2.10) of Digital Securities. A DSF, holding an FSP for Providing Custody, may provide custody and settlement services in Digital Securities for RIEs and MTFs (as applicable).  Therefore, for the purposes of custody and settlement of Digital Securities, the arrangements that a RIE or MTF would normally have in place with a RCH can be replaced with arrangements provided by a DSF, provided that certain requirements, as described in this section, are met.\n",

In choosing a RCH or DSF to utilise for custody operations (MIR Rule 2.10) or settlement (MIR Rule 3.3), a RIE or MTF can only use a RCH or DSF when the FSRA has been able to determine that the relevant settlement facility allows the RIE or MTF to meet its MIR obligations.

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) Framework: This framework is relevant to the requirements for identifying and managing conflicts of interest, internal and external audit, and information technology systems (Section (b), (c), and (d)).\n3. The Risk Management Framework: The framework is essential for Authorised Persons to recognize and control Credit Risk arising from new products and services, including conducting formal risk assessments and establishing appropriate policies, procedures, and controls approved by the Governing Body (Risk control section).\n4. The FATF Guidance: This guidance is applicable to VASPs and national authorities, providing a framework for understanding and developing regulatory and supervisory responses to VA activities, including AML/CFT obligations, licensing or registration, and preventive measures (FATF Guidance section).\n\nIn implementing these frameworks, the Recognised Body's Governing Body should ensure that the following key requirements are met:\n\n* The allocation of responsibilities between Key Individuals is regularly reviewed and updated (Section (a)(v)).\n* The performance of Key Individuals is supervised and reviewed, with arrangements in place for their appointment, supervision, and remuneration (Section (a)(iv) and (v)).\n* Conflicts of interest are identified and managed effectively (Section (b)).\n* Internal and external audit arrangements are in place to ensure the effectiveness of systems and controls (Section (c)).\n* Information technology systems are suitable for the scale and nature of the business (Section (d)).\n* Credit Risk policies, procedures, and controls are established and approved by the Governing Body or its delegated committee (Risk control section).\n* AML/CFT obligations are understood and complied with, including customer due diligence, recordkeeping, and suspicious transaction reporting (FATF Guidance section).\n\nBy adopting these frameworks and meeting the specified requirements, a Recognised Body's Governing Body can ensure that the allocation of responsibilities, appointments, supervision, and remuneration of Key Individuals are effectively reviewed and managed, aligning with the ADGM's regulatory expectations."

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that directly addresses the question, aligning with each sentence in the source passage:\n\nTo handle the recognition and treatment of credit risk mitigations for off-balance sheet exposures, Authorized Persons should calculate the Credit Risk Capital Requirement for these exposures and apply a risk weight based on a Credit Quality Grade aligned with the likelihood of Counterparty default (a). When doing so, they should reduce the Credit Risk Capital Requirement where the Exposure is covered fully or partly by some form of eligible Credit Risk mitigant (c). Specifically, for off-balance sheet exposures related to import or export financing contracts based on Murabaha, where the underlying goods or shipment are collateralized and insured, Authorized Persons should attract a 20% CCF to the issuer or confirmer of the letter of credit (c). \n\nIn contrast to on-balance sheet items, off-balance sheet exposures require similar risk weight application and Credit Risk Capital Requirement calculation, with consideration for eligible Credit Risk mitigants. The main difference lies in the specific CCF percentage applicable to certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as the 20% CCF for collateralized and insured Murabaha-based financing contracts. \n\nNotably, Authorized Persons in Category 2 or an Authorised Person that is a Domestic Firm in Category 3A must also establish and maintain a senior management structure to manage Liquidity Risk, identify, assess, mitigate, control and monitor Liquidity Risk, and monitor the Authorised Person's overall Liquidity Risk profile on a regular basis (Requirements imposed on an Authorised Person in Category 2 or 3A)."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is as follows:\n\nThe FSRA does not explicitly have a dedicated point of contact or support team for potential issuers to consult with during the preparation and execution stages of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). However, issuers intending to make cross-border Offers and listings (within or from ADGM markets) are expected to engage with the FSRA at a very early stage when considering doing so, as stated in the MARKETS RULES \u2013 LISTING RULES.\n\nIn this engagement, the FSRA will likely assess the jurisdiction of the primary listing and ensure that it meets the regulatory standards deemed suitable by the FSRA. This is because the FSRA does not currently allow listings of Digital Securities within ADGM on a secondary listing basis where the primary listing remains outside of the ADGM, and in a jurisdiction that is not yet appropriately understood or deemed suitable by the FSRA.\n\nFurthermore, in relation to the custody of virtual assets, Virtual Asset Custodians are required to meet the additional Rules set out in COBS Rule 17.8, which includes the requirement to treat Virtual Assets as \"Client Assets\" and \"Client Investments\" affording them the same protections as other similar products and activities under the FSMR and the FSRA Rulebook.\n\nIn cases involving suspected money laundering or terrorist financing, the Regulator may take action, including imposing a requirement restricting an Authorised Person or Recognised Body from disposing of or transferring property, and applying to the ADGM Courts for an order restraining a Person from transferring or disposing of any assets suspected of relating to money laundering or terrorist financing, in coordination with the FIU.\n\nOverall, while there is no dedicated support team, potential issuers are encouraged to engage with the FSRA early on to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and to address any concerns or issues that may arise during the preparation and execution stages of an ICO."

COBS: The MTF must demonstrate that it can comply with COBS Chapter 15, specifically ensuring that it maintains systems and controls to enable it to comply with the Safe Custody Rules, and that Safe Custody Investments are registered, recorded or held in accordance with these rules (COBS 15).\n\n2. MIR: The MTF must comply with the applicable requirements under MIR, which will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific Digital Securities-related financial services it will undertake.\n\n3. GEN: The MTF must comply with the general requirements under GEN, including those related to its financial resources, risk management, and internal controls, to ensure that it can operate a MTF in the context of Digital Securities.\n\n4. AML: The MTF must comply with the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, which will involve implementing robust systems and controls to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, particularly in the context of Digital Securities.\n\nTo demonstrate compliance with these requirements, the MTF will need to engage heavily with the FSRA throughout the application process, which will involve the following five stages:\n\na) Due Diligence & Discussions with FSRA team(s);\nb) Submission of Formal Application;\nc) Granting of In Principle Approval;\nd) Granting of Final Approval; and\ne) \u2018Operational Launch\u2019 Testing.\n\nDuring this process, the MTF will need to provide detailed information and explanations to the FSRA, including a Safe Custody Auditor's Report, which must state the extent to which the MTF was holding and controlling Client Investments, Arranging Custody or Providing Custody, and confirm that it has complied with the Safe Custody Rules and other applicable requirements.\n\nBy complying with these requirements and procedures, the Virtual Asset MTF can demonstrate its ability to operate a MTF in the context of Digital Securities, and obtain the necessary approvals from the FSRA."

            "INTERACTION OF CHAPTER 11 WITH OTHER RULE DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. Prior to a Mining Reporting Entity having all the information available to it, the FSRA considers that whatever material information it may have about the mining activity will generally be insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure under the Rules.  Therefore, provided the material information is and remains confidential, and the FSRA has not formed the view that the information ceases to remain confidential (e.g., where there are exceptions from disclosing the information), the material information is not immediately required to be disclosed under Rule 7.2.1.  For more information, please refer to Chapter 7 of the Rules, and any relevant Guidance that the FSRA may publish from time in relation to the FSRA\u2019s expectations as to how Reporting Entities are to comply with Chapter 7.\n\n",

Additional disclosure requirements also apply if they are listed companies. The requirements in this Rulebook are tailored to Authorised Persons and are designed to augment and not to exclude the application of those requirements.\n",
            "Although the Fund Managers of Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds are not subject to the Shari'a review process required under IFR \u200e6.3, they would need to ensure that the Exempt Fund or Qualified Investor Fund continues to meet the Shari'a requirements, particularly for the purposes of their annual and interim reports, which are required to be prepared under Chapter 16 of the Fund Rules. However, the manner in which they demonstrate to the Unitholders of the Fund how they achieve such compliance is a matter left to negotiation (i.e. subject to contractual terms) between the Unitholders and the Fund Manager."
        ],
        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the specific types of distributions to shareholders that fall under the reporting requirement beyond dividends are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the requirement encompasses various material information related to the mining activity, which may not necessarily be limited to dividends.\n\nAccording to the context, the FSRA considers that whatever material information a Mining Reporting Entity may have about the mining activity will generally be insufficiently definite to warrant disclosure under the Rules, unless the information is no longer confidential or the FSRA has formed the view that the information ceases to remain confidential. This implies that the reporting requirement extends to any material information that becomes publicly available or is no longer confidential.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule, specifically where there are exceptions from disclosing the information. Additionally, the context notes that the requirements in the Rulebook are tailored to Authorised Persons and are designed to augment, not exclude, the application of other requirements, such as those relating to shareholder and minority protection and responsibilities of the Board of Directors of companies.\n\nIn the case of listed companies, additional disclosure requirements apply. Furthermore, Fund Managers of Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds are required to ensure compliance with Shari'a requirements, particularly for the purposes of their annual and interim reports, as specified in Chapter 16 of the Fund Rules. However, the manner in which they demonstrate compliance is subject to contractual terms between the Unitholders and the Fund Manager.\n\nTo summarize, the reporting requirement beyond dividends encompasses material information related to the mining activity, which may become publicly available or is no longer confidential, with exceptions where disclosure is not required. The rule is subject to additional requirements and exceptions applicable to Authorised Persons, listed companies, and Fund Managers of Exempt Funds and Qualified Investor Funds."

            "Chapter \u200e5 explains the meaning of the risk-based approach (\"RBA\"), which should be applied when complying with the AML Rulebook. The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nAccording to the regulatory requirements, the ADGM Climate Transition Fund's annual report must include specific third-party sustainability metrics that are recognized and accepted by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) for evaluating the environmental progress of real estate and infrastructure assets. These metrics are essential to measure the progress of the assets in becoming more environmentally sustainable. \n\nThe recognized third-party sustainability metrics may include, but are not limited to, globally accepted standards such as GRESB, GRI, or CDP, which provide a framework for assessing the environmental impact of real estate and infrastructure assets. The Fund Manager must specify the chosen metrics in the annual report to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nMoreover, the Fund Manager must also disclose the timeframe for improvement relied upon when making the investment in such real estate and infrastructure assets. This timeframe is crucial in setting realistic targets for the assets to achieve the desired level of environmental sustainability.\n\nIn addition to the above, the annual report must also include the actual progress of the real estate or infrastructure assets against the relevant sustainability metrics identified in the report. This information enables investors to track the fund's performance in achieving its environmental objectives and make informed decisions.\n\nFurthermore, where third-party attestation (TPA) is required for ADGM Climate Transition Funds, it provides investors with additional comfort that the assets in the fund are aligned with their expectations regarding environmental credentials. The TPA process verifies the fund's compliance with its stated environmental objectives, adding an extra layer of assurance for investors.\n\nIt is worth noting that the ADGM Climate Transition Fund must also comply with applicable sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions issued or administered by the U.A.E. The fund must establish and maintain effective systems and controls to comply with these sanctions, as set out in Chapter 11 of the AML Rulebook. This ensures that the fund operates in accordance with the regulatory framework and minimizes the risk of non-compliance.\n\nIn summary, the ADGM Climate Transition Fund's annual report must include recognized third-party sustainability metrics, a timeframe for improvement, and actual progress against those metrics. The fund must also comply with third-party attestation requirements and applicable sanctions, including Targeted Financial Sanctions, to ensure transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, here is a structured answer to the question:\n\nThe FSRA can provide guidance on the frequency and format of compliance reporting that your company is expected to submit to ensure ongoing adherence to these regulatory standards.\n\n**Disclosure Obligations**: The FSRA establishes a high bar for compliance by Mining Reporting Entities, and as such, it is essential to comply with the disclosure obligations imposed by the FSRA (Source: \"Offers, and Admission to FSRA Official List of Securities\").\n\n**Threshold Conditions**: To determine the frequency and format of compliance reporting, your company needs to assess whether it satisfies the Threshold Conditions, which are either a 'turnover' threshold (more than US$ 68 million turnover in a financial year) or an 'AUM' threshold (managing funds and/or portfolios with an aggregate value exceeding US$ 6 billion at any time during a financial year) (Source: \"Threshold conditions\").\n\n**ESG Disclosures Framework**: If your company meets the Threshold Conditions, it will be required to comply with the ESG Disclosures Framework, which outlines specific reporting requirements (Source: \"Threshold conditions\"). The ESG Disclosures Framework does not apply to companies that no longer meet the threshold conditions for two consecutive years or more (Source: \"Threshold conditions\").\n\n**Reporting Suspicious Activity**: In addition to the ESG Disclosures Framework, your company needs to comply with guidance issued by the EOCN regarding reporting suspicious activity and Transactions relating to money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (Source: \"Relevant Persons\").\n\n**Ongoing Compliance**: To ensure ongoing adherence to these regulatory standards, your company should submit compliance reports according to the frequency and format specified by the FSRA, taking into account the Threshold Conditions and the ESG Disclosures Framework (Source: \"ESG Disclosures Framework\" and \"Threshold conditions\").\n\n**Clear and Rational Set of Regulatory Requirements**: The FSRA aims to provide a clear and rational set of regulatory requirements, enabling Mining Reporting Entities to understand and ensure compliance with the requirements (Source: \"Offers, and Admission to FSRA Official List of Securities\").\n\nIn summary, to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards, your company should:\n\n1. Assess its Threshold Conditions\n2. Comply with the ESG Disclosures Framework if applicable\n3. Report suspicious activity and Transactions as required by the EOCN\n4. Submit compliance reports according to the frequency and format specified by the FSRA\n\nBy following these steps, your company can ensure that it meets the regulatory obligations outlined by the FSRA, providing a clear and suitably regulated framework for stakeholders and the market."

This includes any contravention of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations (FSMR) or Rules, or any failure to disclose information to the Regulator, that may have resulted in or is likely to result in:\n\n* Loss to customers (Section 233(3) of FSMR);\n* Damage to the reputation of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) (Section 233(3) of FSMR);\n* An increased risk that a firm, Recognised Body, or Reporting Entity may be used for the purposes of financial crime (Section 233(3) of FSMR).\n\nAdditionally, the auditor or actuary must consider the nature and seriousness of any contravention, as well as any action taken to remedy the contravention, in deciding what matters to communicate to the Regulator.\n\nThe thresholds or criteria that define the importance of such matters include:\n\n* The severity of the contravention and its impact on customers, the ADGM's reputation, or the risk of financial crime;\n* Any disciplinary action taken or to be taken by a relevant professional body, and whether that action adequately addresses the particular contravention;\n* The previous compliance record of the auditor or actuary, including any previous disciplinary sanctions imposed by the relevant regulatory body or professional body.\n\nIn the context of spot commodity activities, the auditor or actuary must also consider the capital requirements applicable to the Regulated Activities engaged in using Spot Commodities, as well as other Regulated Activities under the FSRA Prudential \u2013 Investment, Insurance Intermediation and Banking Rules (\"PRU\").

This is a critical regulatory requirement, as stated in the Guidance issued under section 15(2) of the Financial Services and Markets Regulations 2015 (FSMR).\n\nTo comply with their tax reporting obligations, entities must identify and report relevant information to the competent authorities in accordance with the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017 and FATCA. This may include reporting information on reportable accounts, as defined under FATCA and the ADGM Regulations, and exchanging information with other jurisdictions as required.\n\nIn the context of Digital Securities transactions and holdings, entities must ensure that they have the necessary systems and controls in place to identify and report reportable accounts, including those held by parties involved in Digital Securities transactions. This may involve implementing procedures to identify U.S. reportable accounts under FATCA and reportable accounts under the ADGM Regulations, as well as procedures to report and exchange information as required.\n\nEntities must also consider their obligations under the ADGM's regulatory framework, including the Financial Services Regulatory Authority's (FSRA) Guidance & Policies Manual, the 'Guidance \u2013 Regulation of Digital Security Offerings (ICOs) and Virtual Assets under the FSMR', the 'Guidance \u2013 Regulation of Virtual Asset Activities in ADGM', and the 'Guidance \u2013 Regulatory Framework for Private Financing Platforms'. These guidelines provide additional regulatory requirements and expectations for entities operating in the ADGM, including those related to disclosure, transparency, and reporting.\n\nFurthermore, Listed Entities must comply with the disclosure obligations set out in APP 1.A.2.1.1, including making required disclosures within the specified timeframe in respect of the Securities identified in column 4 of the Table. This includes making market disclosures of material changes to the Shari'a nature of Listed Securities, as determined by the Shari'a Supervisory Board, and obtaining and disclosing new Shari'a opinions where there are material changes to the structure of the Listed Securities or the use of proceeds.\n\nIn summary, entities within the ADGM must interpret and apply their tax reporting obligations under FATCA and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017 in the context of Digital Securities transactions and holdings by identifying and reporting reportable accounts, implementing necessary systems and controls, and complying with ADGM's regulatory framework and disclosure obligations."

This verification is critical to recognizing the effects of collateralization under the Financial Collateral Simple Approach (FCSA) and to calculating the Credit Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) amount for the collateralized portion of the exposure."

This means that the Authorized Person must determine the country or region where the credit risk is located, as this will affect the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate. For example, if an Authorized Person has private sector credit exposures in countries A, B, and C, it must identify the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates applicable to each country, such as 2.0%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, respectively. The Authorized Person must then calculate the weighted average of the applicable Countercyclical Capital Buffer rates based on the private sector credit exposures in each country. When calculating the weighted average, the Authorized Person should consider the total risk exposure amount and the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate for each country. If the private sector credit exposure is located in ADGM or the UAE, the Countercyclical Capital Buffer rate is the rate set by the Central Bank from time to time, subject to a maximum rate of 2.5%, and any increase in the rate takes effect from the date specified by the Central Bank.

The Insurer's capital adequacy calculation is therefore also an indication of the degree of capital adequacy of the Financial Group of which it is the Parent.

In interpreting Rule 7.2.1, the Listing Authority considers that a Reporting Entity  becomes \u2018aware\u2019 of Inside Information if, and as soon as, an Officer  of the Reporting Entity has, or ought reasonably to have, come into possession of the Inside Information in the course of the performance of their duties as an Officer of that Reporting Entity.\n",

It is likely in these circumstances that the Listing Authority will take the view that the Inside Information is no longer confidential and/or that a reasonable person would expect the information to be Disclosed.

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nWhen calculating capital requirements for CVA risk, eligible hedges should be treated as follows to avoid inclusion in the calculation of capital requirements for specific risk or as credit risk mitigation for other portfolios:\n\n1. **Exclusion from Specific Risk**: Eligible hedges should not be included in the calculation of Specific Risk Capital Requirements. This is ensured by not adding the Delta weighted positions of these hedges to the net positions in the relevant risk category (Rule A6.6.7(a)).\n2. **Treatment under Market Risk**: Eligible hedges should be treated as part of the Option positions, and their Capital Requirements should be calculated separately for Gamma risk (Rule A6.6.8-9) and Vega risk (Rule A6.6.10).\n3. **Inclusion in CVA Capital Requirements**: Eligible hedges should be recognized as CVA hedges and included in the calculation of capital requirements for CVA risk, but only if the Authorised Person has not chosen to set its capital requirement for CVA risk as equal to 100% of its capital requirement for Counterparty Credit Risk (with Regulator's written approval).\n4. **Internal Model Requirements**: To capture the effects of eligible hedges, an internal model used for calculating Capital Requirements for Specific Risk should meet the additional requirements outlined in Rules A6.6.8-10, including explaining historical price variation, capturing concentration and event risk, and being robust to an adverse environment.\n5. **Back Testing**: The internal model should be validated through back testing, which should assess whether Specific Risk is being accurately captured, including the effects of eligible hedges. If back testing is performed on relevant sub-portfolios, these should be chosen in a consistent manner.\n\nBy following these procedures, eligible hedges can be properly treated to avoid inclusion in the calculation of capital requirements for specific risk or as credit risk mitigation for other portfolios."

In assessing the fitness and propriety of a Relevant Person, the Regulator takes into account the identity of their business partner and the nature of their relationship (source: context). Specifically, the Regulator considers the fitness and propriety of the members of the Governing Body (a), the applicant's connection with any person or membership of any Group (b), and the suitability of the applicant's Controllers or any other Person (c). \n\nThe Regulator also examines the impact a Controller might have on the applicant's ability to comply with the applicable requirements (d) and the nature of the activities of the applicant and any associated risks that those activities pose to the Regulator's objectives (f). Furthermore, the Regulator evaluates whether the applicant's business model will allow for its affairs and business to be conducted and managed in a sound and prudent manner, having regard to the interests of consumers and the integrity of the ADGM (g). \n\nIn addition, the Regulator assesses whether those who manage the applicant's affairs will have adequate skills and experience and will act with probity (h). Any matter that may harm or have harmed the integrity or reputation of the Regulator or ADGM, including through the carrying on of a business by the applicant for a purpose connected with a Financial Crime, is also taken into account (i). \n\nLastly, the Regulator considers any other relevant matters (j) and requires the Representative Office to notify it of any breach of a Rule or provision of Regulations or Rules, as well as any materially adverse information that would affect the fitness and propriety of the Representative Office or Principal Representative (1 and 2). \n\nIn summary, the reputation and regulatory standing of a connected Person or entity are critical factors in the assessment of a Recognised Body's fitness and propriety, as they can impact the applicant's ability to comply with regulations, manage risk, and maintain the integrity of the ADGM."

This implies that technology system audits should be conducted regularly to identify and address these risks.\n\nThe frequency and depth of technology system audits should be sufficient to ensure the implementation of robust business procedures, including security measures, systems development methodologies, and system penetration testing. The FSRA's Guidance provides specific expectations regarding controls and processes to mitigate technology-related risks, and Authorised Persons should ensure that their technology system audits are aligned with these expectations.\n\nThe FSRA's emphasis on the importance of continuous disclosure (Rule 7.2.1) also implies that technology system audits should be conducted on an ongoing basis to ensure the timely flow of accurate information and to identify any potential risks or issues that could impact the integrity of the Official List and ADGM's Securities markets.\n\nIn the context of stablecoins, the FSRA's expectations (as outlined in paragraphs 162-166 of the Virtual Assets Guidance) suggest that Authorised Persons should conduct technology system audits that take into account the specific risks and requirements associated with the use of stablecoins, particularly in scenarios where they are used as payment/transaction mechanisms solely within a platform/ecosystem.\n\nOverall, the FSRA's expectations regarding technology system audits for Authorised Persons engaged in regulated activities related to virtual assets are centered around ensuring the implementation of robust technology governance and controls, ongoing monitoring and risk assessment, and timely disclosure of accurate information to maintain the integrity of ADGM's Securities markets."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, here is a detailed and structured answer to the question:\n\nThe frequency or set of triggers for reviewing and updating the risk assessment of a customer, especially for high-risk customers that necessitate Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (ECDD) measures, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, the context emphasizes the importance of ongoing risk assessment and mitigation measures. \n\nTo ensure compliance, a Relevant Person should develop and implement policies and procedures for the sharing of information between Group entities, including the sharing of information relating to Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and money laundering risks (Rule 6.2.1(c) and (a)). This implies that the risk assessment of a customer should be reviewed and updated regularly, taking into account new information or changes in the customer's risk profile.\n\nAdditionally, a Relevant Person must remain aware of the money laundering risks of the Group as a whole and of its exposure to the Group, and take active steps to mitigate such risks (Rule 6.2.1(c)). This suggests that the risk assessment of a customer should be reviewed and updated in response to changes in the Group's overall risk profile or exposure.\n\nFurthermore, Financial Counterparties and Non-Financial Counterparties are required to ensure that appropriate procedures and arrangements are in place to measure, monitor, and mitigate operational risk and Counterparty Credit Risk (Rule 6.2.1(e)). This implies that the risk assessment of a customer should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the customer's operational risk and creditworthiness.\n\nIn summary, while there is no specific recommended frequency or set of triggers for reviewing and updating the risk assessment of a customer, a Relevant Person should review and update the risk assessment regularly, taking into account new information or changes in the customer's risk profile, the Group's overall risk profile or exposure, and changes in operational risk and creditworthiness. This will help ensure that the risk assessment remains accurate and up-to-date, enabling the implementation of effective risk mitigation measures, including ECDD for high-risk customers."

        ],
        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the answer to the question is as follows:\n\nA Credit Rating Agency cannot include revenue generated from credit ratings as a factor in the remuneration of its employees involved in those ratings, as this would be in direct contradiction to the regulatory requirement that employees must not be remunerated based on the amount of revenue generated or expected from the credit ratings in which the employee was involved.\n\nTo comply with regulatory obligations, a Credit Rating Agency must ensure that employees involved in the provision of credit ratings have reporting lines and remuneration arrangements that are designed to eliminate, or effectively manage, actual and potential conflicts of interest. This means that the agency must establish a system of remuneration that is independent of the revenue generated from credit ratings and focuses on objective performance metrics that promote the integrity and quality of the credit rating process.\n\nIn addition to ensuring the independence of remuneration, a Credit Rating Agency must also assist investors in developing a greater understanding of what a credit rating is, and the limits to which credit ratings can be put to use vis-\u00e0-vis a particular type of financial product that the Credit Rating Agency rates. This includes clearly indicating the attributes and limitations of each credit opinion, and the limits to which the Credit Rating Agency verifies information provided to it by the issuer or originator of a rated security.\n\nIn summary, a Credit Rating Agency must prioritize the integrity and independence of its credit rating process by establishing remuneration arrangements that are decoupled from revenue generation, and by providing transparent and accurate information to investors about the limitations and attributes of its credit ratings."

This includes both digital and physical access. Authorised Persons should have processes and procedures to track and monitor access to all network resources. Logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities are critical in preventing, detecting, or minimising the impact of a data compromise. The maintenance of logs allows thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis when issues occur.\n",
            "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nHistorically, Virtual Asset business failures have often arisen as a result of the lack of adequate technology-related procedures, including, for example, lack of security measures, systems development methodologies, limited system penetration testing for operating a robust business and lack of technical leadership and management.  The FSRA has therefore included specific Guidance regarding expected controls and processes to help mitigate these issues.\n",

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues. The implication therefore is that where an MTF or RIE, for example, controls access to a distributed ledger there may be a limit/restriction on an investor to transfer Digital Securities to another investor. This is in contrast to Virtual Assets (for example, Bitcoin), where access to the Bitcoin distributed ledger is not permissioned.\n"

        "Answer": "Based on the provided regulatory documents, the FSRA's minimum requirements for digital and physical access controls to sensitive data within a company dealing with virtual assets can be outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Restrict access to critical and/or sensitive data**: Access to sensitive data should be restricted to key personnel only, including both digital and physical access (Management of personnel and decision making).\n\n2. **Implement processes and procedures to track and monitor access**: Authorised Persons should have processes and procedures in place to track and monitor access to all network resources, including logging mechanisms and the ability to track user activities (Management of personnel and decision making).\n\n3. **Maintain logs for thorough tracking, alerting, and analysis**: The maintenance of logs is critical for tracking, alerting, and analysing issues when they occur, allowing for the prevention, detection, or minimisation of the impact of a data compromise (Management of personnel and decision making).\n\n4. **Implement adequate technology-related procedures**: The FSRA expects Authorised Persons to have adequate technology-related procedures in place, including security measures, systems development methodologies, and regular system penetration testing to ensure a robust business operation (Technology Governance and Controls).\n\n5. **Ensure permissioned access to DLT**: In the context of Digital Securities, the FSRA expects that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues, and therefore, access to a distributed ledger may be controlled by an MTF or RIE, limiting/restricting the transfer of Digital Securities to another investor (DLT Access Implications - Offers, Issuance & Trading).\n\nIn summary, the FSRA's minimum requirements for digital and physical access controls to sensitive data within a company dealing with virtual assets involve restricting access to key personnel, implementing processes to track and monitor access, maintaining logs for thorough tracking and analysis, ensuring adequate technology-related procedures, and controlling permissioned access to DLT in the context of Digital Securities."

This implies that the reporting timeframe is immediate, and the Relevant Person should not delay in notifying the FIU once they have formed a suspicion or have reasonable grounds to suspect illegal activities. \n\nThe regulations emphasize the importance of providing sufficient guidance to the Relevant Person's Employees to enable them to form a suspicion or recognize when they have reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing. This guidance should include training that enables relevant Employees to seek and assess the information required to judge whether a Person is involved in suspicious activity or Transactions related to money laundering or terrorist financing.\n\nFurthermore, the regulations suggest that the Relevant Person should be prepared to undergo regular assessments and thematic reviews from the FSRA, which will help to identify and address any suspicious transactions or activities in a timely manner. This close supervision and ongoing assessments will ensure that the Relevant Person is able to identify and report suspicious transactions to the FIU promptly, without delay.\n\nIn summary, the regulations require the Relevant Person to report suspicious transactions to the FIU immediately upon knowing, suspecting, or having reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing activities, and to undergo regular assessments and training to ensure timely and effective reporting."

        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that directly addresses the question, aligning each sentence with a sentence in the source passage:\n\nWhen conducting the internal Shari'a review, the internal audit function or compliance function should follow a comprehensive and consistent framework to ensure that the review is performed by competent and sufficiently independent individuals or departments. These individuals or departments should be able to assess compliance with Shari'a principles and standards. The Fund Manager should also ensure that the internal audit function or compliance function of the Fund performs the internal Shari'a review, with the same requirements of competence and sufficient independence applying.

        "Answer": "To define and document the activities and functions of a Fund Administrator in accordance with Rule 17.1.5, the following measures should be taken to avoid ambiguity and ensure compliance:\n\nFirstly, the agreement between the parties should include unambiguous descriptions and definitions of the activities and functions to be provided by the Fund Administrator, as well as the duties to be performed by both parties, as stipulated in Rule 17.1.5(a). This will help to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party, reducing the risk of misunderstandings or misinterpretations.\n\nSecondly, the agreement should specify an agreed standard in respect of resources and services supported by performance measures in accordance with the applicable legislation, as required by Rule 17.1.5(b). This will ensure that the Fund Administrator's performance can be objectively evaluated and monitored.\n\nThirdly, the Fund Administrator should be required to provide regular detailed reporting to a specified frequency, as outlined in Rule 17.1.5(c). This reporting should include information on the duties and activities performed by the Fund Administrator, enabling the Foreign Fund Manager to monitor and assess its performance.\n\nFourthly, the agreement should include provisions relating to the reporting of relevant events, such as technological changes or error reporting, as well as any event that undermines the ability of the Fund Administrator to fulfil its duties, as stipulated in Rule 17.1.5(d). This will enable the parties to respond promptly and effectively to any issues that may arise.\n\nFifthly, the agreement should require an annual review (at a minimum) of the performance of the functions by the Fund Administrator, as outlined in Rule 17.1.5(e). This review should assess the Fund Administrator's compliance with the agreed standards and performance measures, identifying areas for improvement and ensuring that its duties are being fulfilled effectively.\n\nFinally, the agreement should include provisions relating to records and adequate access by the Foreign Fund Manager, the Fund's auditor, or any other Persons providing control or risk management functions for the Fund, as required by the Foreign Fund Manager or applicable laws, as stated in Rule 17.1.5(f). This will ensure that all necessary parties have access to the required information and records to perform their duties and obligations.\n\nIn addition, for Authorised Persons operating an Islamic Window, the financial statements produced under GEN 6 and IFR 4.2.1 should contain the required additional disclosures, including a detailed statement of the funds mobilised according to Shari'a rules and principles and the assets financed by those funds, a detailed statement of the income and expenditure attributable to its Islamic Financial Business, and whether funds attributable to its Islamic Financial Business are commingled with funds attributable to its conventional business.\n\nLastly, the Reporting Entity should consider whether there is any financial or personal relationship between it or any of its relevant Employees and the auditor or any of the relevant Employees of the auditor that may affect the judgement of the auditor when conducting an audit of the Reporting Entity or complying with all its legal obligations, including the FSMR, GEN, AML, and other relevant Rulebooks.

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the ADGM expects senior management of an Insurer to exercise a high level of oversight and review regarding the effectiveness of systems and controls for monitoring Group activities, as follows:\n\n* Senior management should establish and maintain systems and controls to identify and monitor the effect on the Insurer of its relationship with other members of the Group and the activities of other members of its Group. (Aligns with the first sentence of the source passage)\n* These systems and controls should include procedures to monitor changes in relationships between Group members, changes in the activities of Group members, conflicts of interest arising within the Group, and events in the Group, particularly those that may affect the Insurer's own regulatory compliance. (Aligns with points a, b, c, and d of the source passage)\n* Where the Insurer is a member of a Group, it may be practicable for some processes to be performed on a Group-wide basis, but senior management remains responsible under the Rules for the adequacy of its risk management systems, whether or not those processes are outsourced. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"Where the Insurer is a member of a Group...\")\n* Senior management cannot delegate their regulatory responsibility for ensuring that the Insurer's risk management systems are adequate, and the fact that a system is partially or wholly outsourced would be a factor in the Insurer's assessment of whether the system was adequate. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"Senior management cannot delegate...\")\n* To decide whether any system is adequate, senior management would be expected to have assessed the design and operation of the system, including the design and operation of controls over outsourcing decisions and monitoring. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"To decide whether any system...\")\n* Adequate documentary evidence of these assessments should be maintained, as an Insurer must be in a position to demonstrate that it has complied with its regulatory requirements. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"Because an Insurer must...\")\n\nAdditionally, in relation to third-party outsourcing, especially when employing cloud-based data storage services for recording personal data, senior management should:\n\n* Take into consideration ADGM data protection regulations. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"Authorised Persons who employ...\")\n* Consider the jurisdiction within which the cloud storage service provider is located, or alternatively other arrangements which may facilitate compliance with applicable data protection requirements. (Aligns with the paragraph starting with \"Authorised Persons who employ...\")\n\nBy fulfilling these requirements, senior management can demonstrate effective oversight and review of the systems and controls for monitoring Group activities, ensuring compliance with ADGM regulatory requirements."

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question, aligning with the provided regulatory documents and context:\n\nIf an Insurer fails to adequately oversee regulatory compliance for outsourced or delegated functions, the consequences for its senior management will be severe. As stated, the senior management of an Insurer remain responsible for its regulatory compliance, including in any areas that are delegated or outsourced to other Group members (Context). This means that the Board and its committees, including senior management, will be held accountable for ensuring that adequate resources, including access to expertise and timely and comprehensive information, are in place to effectively oversee regulatory compliance (Rule 9.2.5).\n\nIn particular, the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Directors, and Chief Executive, as identified in the annual report of the Reporting Entity, will be responsible for ensuring that the Board has an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the Insurer's business to effectively oversee regulatory compliance (Context). The annual report must include a high-level statement of which types of decisions are to be taken by the Board and which are to be delegated to Senior Management, highlighting their responsibilities in this regard (Context).\n\nFurthermore, the Regulator will consider the nature of the relationship between the Insurer and the person or entity with whom they have Close Links, whether those Close Links are likely to prevent effective supervision, and whether the Foreign Provisions, if applicable, would prevent effective supervision (Assessing Close Links). If the Insurer fails to adequately oversee regulatory compliance, its senior management may be found to have breached their regulatory obligations, leading to potential enforcement actions by the Regulator.\n\nIn summary, the consequences for an Insurer's senior management if it fails to adequately oversee regulatory compliance for outsourced or delegated functions include being held accountable for breaches of regulatory obligations, potential enforcement actions by the Regulator, and ultimately, reputational damage and financial losses. Senior management must ensure that adequate resources, expertise, and information are in place to effectively oversee regulatory compliance, and that they have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the Insurer's business to do so."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, there are no direct exceptions or specific conditions mentioned where a dealer would not be required to register a transaction via goAML for sales equal to or exceeding USD 15,000. However, the obligation to register such transactions is not absolute and depends on the specific circumstances of the transaction.\n\nFor instance, the requirement to register transactions via goAML applies to all cash transactions equal to or exceeding USD 15,000 with individuals and all cash or wire transfer transactions equal to or exceeding USD 15,000 with entities, as stated in the FIU guide (a). This implies that if the transaction does not involve cash or wire transfer, or if the amount is less than USD 15,000, registration via goAML may not be required.\n\nFurthermore, the requirements for real estate agents in guide (b) specifically outline the conditions under which registration via goAML is necessary, including cash transactions of USD 15,000 or more, payment using Virtual Assets, or payment involving funds converted from or to a Virtual Asset. This suggests that if the transaction does not meet these specific conditions, registration via goAML may not be required.\n\nIt is essential to note that the provided context does not mention any other exceptions or conditions that would exempt a dealer from registering transactions via goAML. Therefore, it is implied that dealers must comply with the registration requirement for all transactions equal to or exceeding USD 15,000, unless the transaction falls under a specific category that is not explicitly mentioned in the guides.\n\nIn summary, while there are no direct exceptions mentioned, the regulation requires dealers to register transactions via goAML for sales equal to or exceeding USD 15,000, subject to the specific conditions and circumstances outlined in the FIU guides. Dealers must ensure compliance with these requirements to avoid any potential regulatory non-compliance."

        ],
        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer to the question:\n\nThe application of liquidity facilities in securitization is a critical aspect of credit risk management and the calculation of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs). When it comes to calculating Credit RWAs arising from securitisations, an Authorised Person is required to include all securitisation Exposures, including those arising from the provision of credit risk mitigants, investments in asset-backed securities, retention of a subordinated tranche, extension of a liquidity facility, and extension of credit enhancement (Rule 4.14.12).\n\nIn the context of liquidity facilities, it is essential to recognize that the extension of such facilities is considered a securitisation Exposure that must be included in the calculation of Credit RWAs (Rule 4.14.12(d)). This means that Authorised Persons must ensure that they have adequate systems and controls in place to measure and manage the credit risk associated with these facilities.\n\nImplicit Support is another critical aspect of credit risk management in securitization. If an Originator fails to comply with Rule 4.14.15 in respect of a securitisation, it must include all the underlying Exposures of the securitisation in its calculation of Credit RWAs as if those Exposures had not been securitised and were on the balance sheet of the Authorised Person (Rule 4.14.15(a)). Additionally, the Originator must not recognise any gain on sale of assets to the securitisation and must disclose to investors that the Authorised Person has provided non-contractual support and the regulatory capital impact of doing so (Rule 4.14.15(b) and (c)).\n\nWhen establishing a delivery and/or storage facility, an Authorised Person must ensure that it operates under rules and regulations equivalent to those applying in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (Rule 22.4.1(a)). The facility must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including local port conditions, customs requirements, anticorruption laws, taxation requirements, and other relevant rules and regulations (Rule 22.4.1(b)). Furthermore, the facility must adhere to appropriate international standards for storage and delivery mechanisms, including those outlined in IOSCO's Good and Sound Practices, and must have OHSAS 18001 Health & Safety Management or equivalent certification standards (Rule 22.4.1(c)(i) and (ii)).\n\nIn addition, the facility must have appropriate audit and control arrangements in place, including inventories, deliveries, and physical infrastructure (Rule 22.4.1(d)), as well as appropriate insurance arrangements to cover operational, security, fraud, natural disasters, and other applicable risks (Rule 22.4.1(e)).\n\nIn conclusion, the application of liquidity facilities in securitization is subject to stringent regulatory requirements and procedures. Authorised Persons must ensure that they comply with all applicable rules and regulations, including those related to credit risk management, implicit support, and delivery and/or storage facilities, to avoid any adverse regulatory capital impacts."

        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nTo obtain written confirmation from an Auditor regarding the change of financial year-end, an Authorised Person, such as a Fund Manager, must follow a specific process. Firstly, the Fund Manager must obtain written confirmation from its Auditor that the change of its annual accounting period would not result in any significant distortion of the financial position of the Fund (a). \n\nA \"significant distortion\" of an Authorised Person's financial position refers to a situation where the change of financial year-end would materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the financial statements, potentially misleading stakeholders about the Authorised Person's true financial condition. \n\nOnce the written confirmation from the Auditor is obtained, the Fund Manager must then obtain the Regulator's prior consent before implementing the change (b). The Regulator may grant or withhold consent, taking into account various factors, including the potential impact of the change on the Authorised Person's financial position and the interests of stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, the Regulator may impose additional requirements or conditions on the Authorised Person, such as maintaining an additional buffer of liquid assets, if it assesses that the Authorised Person has failed to carry out stress tests effectively. This additional requirement aims to ensure that the Authorised Person maintains a sufficient level of liquidity to withstand potential financial shocks and protect the interests of stakeholders.\n\nIn summary, the process for obtaining written confirmation from an Auditor regarding the change of financial year-end involves obtaining Auditor confirmation that the change would not result in a significant distortion of the financial position, followed by obtaining the Regulator's prior consent. A significant distortion of an Authorised Person's financial position is a material change that could affect the accuracy or reliability of financial statements, and the Regulator may impose additional requirements to ensure the Authorised Person's financial stability and stakeholder protection."

Reconfirm the Competent Person statement in relation to the original disclosure of the estimates of Ore Reserves and/or Mineral Resources, as part of meeting its obligations under the Mining Reporting Standards and the Rules.\n\n2.

If the Production Target is wholly based on Ore Reserves, or a combination of Ore Reserves and Measured Mineral Resources, or a combination of Ore Reserves, Measured Mineral Resources, and/or Indicated Mineral Resources (provided that the Indicated Mineral Resources are not the determining factor in project viability), no additional requirements apply.\n\n4. If the Production Target is based on Indicated Mineral Resources or Measured Mineral Resources, the Mining Reporting Entity must give sufficient consideration to the modifying factors and clearly disclose the material assumptions made in this regard.\n\n5. If the Mining Reporting Entity has included some level of Inferred Mineral Resources or an Exploration Target in the Production Target, it must confirm that the respective proportions of Inferred Mineral Resources or Exploration Target are not the determining factors in the viability of the Production Target and do not feature as a significant proportion in the early mine plan.\n\n6. If the Production Target is wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources, the Mining Reporting Entity must comply with Rule 11.8.3(5).\n\nBy following these steps, the Mining Reporting Entity can ensure that its disclosure of a Production Target meets the regulatory requirements and provides a reasonable basis for investors and stakeholders to understand the entity's production expectations."

For existing operational virtual asset exchanges that already have their order book / matching engine outside ADGM prior to making an application, a determination of which parts (if not all) of its order book (and how its matching engine) will come under FSRA regulatory oversight needs to be made by the Applicant,  to allow it to apply to become authorised as an MTF.\n",

            "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\nTechnology Governance and Controls\nHistorically, Virtual Asset business failures have often arisen as a result of the lack of adequate technology-related procedures, including, for example, lack of security measures, systems development methodologies, limited system penetration testing for operating a robust business and lack of technical leadership and management.  The FSRA has therefore included specific Guidance regarding expected controls and processes to help mitigate these issues.\n"
        ],
        "Answer": "Here is a detailed and structured answer that directly addresses the question:\n\nFor start-up MTFs, the substance requirements dictate that their entire order book and the functionality of their matching engine will be subject to FSRA oversight. This means that all aspects of the order book and matching engine, including their design, development, testing, and operation, must comply with FSRA regulations and guidelines.\n\nFor existing operational virtual asset exchanges, the determination of which parts of their order book and matching engine will fall under FSRA regulatory oversight depends on the specific circumstances of the exchange. The Applicant must assess and identify which components of their order book and matching engine were outside ADGM prior to making an application and determine which parts will come under FSRA oversight. This assessment should consider the entire order book and matching engine, including their design, development, testing, and operation, to ensure that all relevant components are identified and comply with FSRA regulations and guidelines.\n\nIn addition to the order book and matching engine, MTFs must also ensure that they have adequate technology governance and controls in place to mitigate operational risks. This includes implementing robust security measures, systems development methodologies, and system penetration testing to prevent business failures. The FSRA has provided specific Guidance regarding expected controls and processes to help mitigate these issues, and MTFs must comply with these guidelines to ensure a robust business.\n\nFurthermore, where spot commodity activities are involved, MTFs must also consider the custody arrangements for accepted spot commodities, such as gold bullion, which require specialist custody arrangements with appropriate secure vault facilities. This includes ensuring that the safekeeping of physical spot commodities is handled by a custodian with the necessary secure facilities to prevent operational risks.\n\nIn summary, the substance requirements for MTFs' order books and matching engines involve full FSRA oversight for start-up MTFs, while existing operational virtual asset exchanges must assess and identify which components of their order book and matching engine will fall under FSRA oversight. Additionally, MTFs must implement robust technology governance and controls, and ensure adequate custody arrangements for spot commodities, to comply with FSRA regulations and guidelines."

        "Answer": "Based on the provided context, the timing for including executed purchase orders in the Required Stable Funding (RSF) calculation is at the settlement date. This is because, as per paragraph (b)(i), \"the effects of such transactions must be reflected in the balance sheet of the Authorised Person when settled.\" This implies that the executed purchase orders are only considered for RSF calculation when they are settled, not at the execution date.\n\nIn more detail, when an Authorised Person executes a purchase order, it must include the financial instruments, foreign currencies, or commodities in its RSF calculation (paragraph (a)(i)). However, this inclusion is contingent upon the settlement of the transaction, as per paragraph (b)(i). This means that the Authorised Person will only take into account the executed purchase orders that have been settled, and not those that are still pending settlement.\n\nIt is essential to note that this treatment applies regardless of whether the Authorised Person uses a settlement-date accounting model or not (paragraph (c)). Moreover, the RSF calculation also involves including or excluding specific securities in secured funding arrangements, such as those lent or borrowed in SFTs, repos, or collateral swaps, depending on whether the Authorised Person retains beneficial ownership and the assets appear on its balance sheet (paragraphs (a) and (b) of the second section).\n\nIn conclusion, the correct timing for including executed purchase orders in the RSF calculation is at the settlement date, and not at the execution date.

        "Answer": "Here is a structured and detailed answer that addresses the question:\n\nThe FSRA expects participants in the commodity markets to meet minimum standards for responsible and sustainable sourcing, which includes adherence to internationally recognized certification standards. These minimum standards aim to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in the Abu Dhabi Global Market, as well as foster confidence and maintain financial stability. To achieve this, participants should establish appropriate risk management systems, including clear definitions and delegations of authority, clear claim settlement procedures, and objective loss estimation procedures. Moreover, participants should implement methods for monitoring compliance with claims management processes and procedures, such as minimum documentation standards, internal audit, peer review of claims paid, assessment of brokers' procedures and systems, and audits of ceding companies.\n\nIn terms of responsible sourcing, participants should ensure that their supply chain management practices are aligned with internationally recognized certification standards, such as those related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. This may include implementing policies and procedures for sourcing commodities from sustainable and responsible sources, as well as conducting regular assessments and audits to ensure compliance with these standards.\n\nTo promote transparency, resilience, and integrity in commodity markets, participants should also maintain adequate records and documentation of their sourcing practices, including information on the origin, quality, and movement of commodities. Furthermore, they should establish appropriate channels for reporting and addressing any concerns or issues related to responsible sourcing, and ensure that their staff and suppliers are trained and aware of the importance of responsible sourcing practices.\n\nOverall, the FSRA's Spot Commodities Framework aims to promote a culture of responsible and sustainable sourcing among participants in the commodity markets, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market."

            "This Chapter deals with the regulatory requirements arising out of the need for Authorised Persons to carry out a self assessment of their risk which can be reviewed and assessed by the Regulator. This Chapter details the Rules stipulating the need to complete internal risk assessments by Authorised Persons in defined frequencies and the Regulator's role in reviewing the results of such assessments. In the case of Authorised Persons facing financial risks, the requirements in this Chapter mandate completion of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. The Regulator will review the results of such internal risk assessments. This Chapter also sets out how the Regulator may impose an additional Capital Requirement on a firm specific basis in addition to the minimum requirement specified in Chapter 3 of these Rules to address higher-than-normal risk."
        ],
        "Answer": "Here is a structured answer that addresses the question and aligns with the regulatory requirements mentioned in the source passage:\n\nAccording to the ADGM regulations, an Authorised Person must treat any materiality thresholds on payments below which no payment will be made in the event of loss as retained First Loss Positions and must deduct the full amount from its Capital Resources. This means that if a guarantee has a materiality threshold that defines a lower bound below which no payment will be made, the entire amount of the guarantee up to that threshold is considered a retained First Loss Position and must be fully deducted from the Authorised Person's Capital Resources.\n\nIn relation to credit risk mitigation, guarantees with materiality thresholds are subject to specific treatment, and the Authorised Person must deduct the full amount of the guarantee up to the materiality threshold from its Capital Resources. This requirement is stated in the context of credit risk mitigation, emphasizing the importance of accurate capital resource calculation and risk assessment.\n\nIn addition to credit risk mitigation, Authorised Persons engaged in regulated activities must comply with international tax reporting obligations, including FATCA and the ADGM Common Reporting Standard Regulations 2017, as required by COBS Rule 17.4. This obligation is separate from the treatment of materiality thresholds in guarantees but is essential for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nFurthermore, Authorised Persons must conduct internal risk assessments, including an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, to identify and manage financial risks. The Regulator will review the results of these assessments and may impose an additional Capital Requirement on a firm-specific basis if deemed necessary to address higher-than-normal risk. This process is critical for ensuring that Authorised Persons maintain adequate capital resources to mitigate risks, including those related to guarantees with materiality thresholds.\n\nIn summary, the treatment of materiality thresholds in guarantees requires Authorised Persons to deduct the full amount from their Capital Resources, and this treatment is part of a broader regulatory framework that encompasses credit risk mitigation, international tax reporting obligations, internal risk assessments, and capital adequacy requirements."
